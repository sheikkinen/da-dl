# Summarization

Start each task by summarizing the conversion so far. Include self reflection and process improvement ideas. Place results in thinking/summary-$(date +%s).md

# References

Add cross-references between files when creating or editing new files. Reference contains filenames with relative paths and it is made on both files.

# AI Friendly summary

Include an AI Friendly summary at the beginning of each file, an overview of the file's content and purpose. Use extreme brevity and clarity.

# Use of Markdown tools

Use markdown tables, embedded Mermaid diagrams and READMNE style filestructures when appropriate.

# Read key files often

Key files are:
# - `tasklist.md` - simple tasklist for regular updates, no thinking updates in this file
# - `story-action-plan.md` - overall methodology reference
# - planning files in `planning/` - working files, e.g. research and all thinking notes
