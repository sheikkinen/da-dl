# Story Action Plan

This file is for story-specific planning, coordination, and tracking within the recursive writing project.

## 14-Phase Story Development Methodology

Based on the successful project, this methodology transforms initial concepts into complete narratives through systematic development phases.

### Core Principles
1. **Sequential Development**: Each phase builds on previous phases - no phase begins until prerequisites complete
2. **Quality Checkpoints**: Built-in validation at every phase prevents accumulation of issues
3. **Universe Integration**: Maintain consistency from initial planning through final narrative
4. **Documentation-First**: Comprehensive documentation enables scalability and maintainability
5. **Priority-Based Development**: Critical story elements developed first ensures core completion

### Phase Categories Overview

#### Foundation Phases (1-4): Planning Foundation
- **Phase 1**: Universe Research - Framework, Timeline, Character Analysis
- **Phase 2**: Structure Development - Scene Breakdown, Character Arcs, Plot Mapping
- **Phase 3**: Research Integration - Historical Context, Relationship Mapping
- **Phase 4**: Planning Completion - Detailed Timeline, Character Integration

#### Documentation Phase (5): Standards Implementation
- **Phase 5**: Documentation Standards - AI Summaries, Cross-References, Quality Framework

#### Development Phases (6-10): Content Creation
- **Phase 6**: Character Creation - Character Files with Detailed Profiles
- **Phase 7**: Plot Detailing - Plot Thread Files with Progression
- **Phase 8**: Scene Drafting - Scene Files with Detailed Beats
- **Phase 9**: Quality Review - Cross-Reference Validation, Continuity Check
- **Phase 10**: Universe Integration - Timeline Sync, Character Validation

#### Narrative Phases (11-14): Story Creation
- **Phase 11**: Narrative Structure - Chapter Structure, Priority Analysis
- **Phase 12**: Priority Development - Critical Scene Narratives (Top 10 scenes)
- **Phase 13**: Complete Development - Full Narrative Coverage (All remaining scenes)
- **Phase 14**: Final Validation - Quality Synchronization, Publication Ready

### Key Success Factors
- **90% Planning, 10% Writing**: Complete planning before narrative creation ensures coherent development
- **Priority-Based Approach**: Develop critical story elements first for flexibility and core completion
- **Quality Integration**: Universe consistency maintained from conception through final narrative
- **Template-Driven Development**: Use established templates for consistency and efficiency


## Usage
- Use this file to outline story arcs, assign tasks, and track progress for each story or major narrative thread.
- Reference templates and tools from `../shared-artifacts/` and `../shared-tools/` as needed. 
- Use the timeline template for chronological planning and update it programmatically as needed.
- Leverage agentic tools (keyword search, inspiration picker, timeline entry, etc.) to support ideation and structure.
- Log major planning actions and decisions for traceability.

## Key files for this project

./story-action-plan.md - this file. do not edit
./timeline.md - world timeline. keep up-to-date
./world.md - overall world description. keep up-to-date
./tasklist.md - primary documents for organizing the work. read and update - do nothing outside the tasklist
./characters folder - copy templates and make updates here
./plots folder - copy templates and make updates here
./scenes folder - copy templates and make updates here
./narratives - create narrative here
./summaries - create story summaries here
./planning - create working files, e.g. research here

# Next step

Read ./tasklist.md and execute next task.

# IMPORTANT

Keep tasklist up to date - don't start a task unless it's documented by you on the tasklist.
**Don't start writing actual narrative before plots, timeline and scene synopses are complete** (Foundation Rule from 14-phase methodology).
Always plan potential for helper tools before solving a task.

**Methodology Note**: The 14-phase process above has proven successful with a 26-chapter political intrigue story achieving 100% quality validation and perfect universe integration. Follow the sequential development principle: complete each phase before moving to the next.
