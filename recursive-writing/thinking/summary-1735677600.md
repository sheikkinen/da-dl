## TASK DESCRIPTION:
Continue executing the character renaming plan for "The Crimson Veil" epic fantasy story, focusing on completing remaining cross-reference updates and finalizing the linguistic authenticity overhaul.

## COMPLETED IN PREVIOUS SESSION:

2. Update remaining cross-references in planning documents
3. Begin location name updates with same authentic European linguistic approach
4. Develop character relationship networks with new names
5. Assign characters to specific kingdoms/factions
