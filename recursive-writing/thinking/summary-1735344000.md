# Conversation Summary - December 28, 2024

## TASK DESCRIPTION
Add new task to create artifacts mimicking those created by source historical characters using the artifact template system.

## CONTEXT
Following completion of character renaming with authentic old European names, the next logical step is to create artifacts that these characters would have created based on their historical inspirations. This includes:
- Strategic treatises (like Sun Tzu's Art of War, Machiavelli's The Prince)
- Religious texts and proclamations (like Pope Urban II's crusade calls)
- Philosophical works (like Confucian Analects, Taoist texts)
- Military manuals and tactical guides
- Political manifestos and governmental reforms
- Literary works (poetry from Cao Cao-inspired character)

## CHANGES MADE
- Added new task section for artifact creation in story-action-plan.md
- Referenced existing artifact template system in shared-artifacts
- Connected artifact creation to completed character development work
- Specified that artifacts should reflect the source historical figures' notable works/creations
- Positioned task logically after character completion but before location filling

## STATUS
Task added to action plan, ready for implementation once current priority tasks are addressed.
