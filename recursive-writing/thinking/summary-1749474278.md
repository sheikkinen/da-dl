# Summary - Session 1749474278

## Task Continuation
Continuing systematic review and editing of 22 narrative chapters to address three key issues:
1. **Issue #1**: Repeated use of word 'substrate' and phrase 'whatever its nature or substrate' (90% complete)
2. **Issue #2**: Prolonged chapter endings that should be concise recaps (90% complete) 
3. **Issue #3**: Misplaced references when moving between chapters (25% complete)

## Previous Session Accomplishments
Successfully condensed verbose endings in 4 additional chapters:
- **10-cartesian-doubt.md**: Reduced 6-paragraph verbose ending to focused learning summary
- **15-dennett-drafts.md**: Condensed ending about consciousness as process
- **17-indigenous-spatial.md**: Reduced ending to concise place-based consciousness summary
- **09-maimonides-knowledge.md**: Condensed 15-line verbose ending to focused summary

## Current Session Goals
1. Complete chapter ending condensation for remaining ~2 chapters (targeting 95-100% completion)
2. Begin systematic reference consistency review across all 22 chapters
3. Address any remaining 'substrate' overuse instances

## Process Improvement Reflection
The chapter-by-chapter approach has been highly effective. Each condensation maintains philosophical depth while improving narrative flow. The methodology of preserving key insights while eliminating redundant elaboration continues to work well.

## Next Steps
1. Search for remaining chapters with verbose endings
2. Begin comprehensive reference consistency review
3. Final quality verification pass
