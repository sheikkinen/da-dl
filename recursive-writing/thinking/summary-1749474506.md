# Session Continuation Summary - 1749474506

## Previous Session Achievements
- Fixed 3 major broken plot-thread references (chapters 18, 19, 22)
- Advanced Issue #3 from 25% to ~75% completion
- Established systematic approach for reference consistency

## Current Session Goals
1. Complete remaining reference consistency fixes
2. Final chapter ending condensation (reach 95-100% completion)
3. Bidirectional reference validation
4. Update completion status in issues.md

## Process Methodology
- Continue systematic grep searches for remaining broken references
- Focus on completing the final 5-10% of verbose ending reductions
- Ensure all cross-references work bidirectionally
- Document final completion status

## Self-Reflection
The previous session made excellent progress on the reference consistency issue. The discovery of the plot-threads vs plots directory mismatch was crucial. Now we need to complete the systematic review and finish the remaining editorial work.
