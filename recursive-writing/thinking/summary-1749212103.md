# Conversation Summary - Balancing Eastern Philosophers

## TASK FOCUS:
Continue character planning for "The Crimson Veil" by adding balancing Eastern philosophers like Confucius to complement the existing Warring States military/political leaders.

## COMPLETED IN PREVIOUS SESSION:
- 4 Warring States character templates (Qin Shi Huang, Zhuge Liang, Cao Cao, Liu Bei)
- Story action plan updated with filling tasks
- Document references updated

## NEW OBJECTIVE:
Add philosophical balance to the Eastern characters by creating templates for:
- **Confucius-inspired**: Moral philosopher and educator
- **Lao Tzu-inspired**: Taoist philosopher advocating wu wei (non-action)
- **Mencius-inspired**: Humanistic philosopher believing in innate goodness
- **Xunzi-inspired**: Pragmatic philosopher emphasizing education and ritual

## CHARACTER BALANCE RATIONALE:
The current Eastern templates focus heavily on military/political leaders from the Warring States period. Adding philosophical figures provides:
- **Moral Guidance**: Confucian ethics and proper governance
- **Spiritual Wisdom**: Taoist naturalness and balance
- **Educational Leadership**: Scholarly influence and mentorship
- **Intellectual Opposition**: Different approaches to human nature and society

## TEMPLATE CREATION PLAN:
1. Create 4 new Eastern philosopher templates
2. Update story action plan with corresponding tasks
3. Add new files to document references
4. Ensure balance between military and philosophical approaches
