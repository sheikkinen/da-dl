# Task Summary - Adding Timeline and Artifact Tasks

## Current Session Goals
Adding two new planning tasks to enhance "The Crimson Veil" story development:

1. **Timeline Revision Task**: Spread character birth dates across a wider historical timespan to create richer multi-generational history and potential prophecies
2. **Artifact Verification Task**: Ensure all character artifacts match their historical counterparts' written works and significant items

## Context
Previous work has established 15 characters with birth dates concentrated in the 900-940 AV period. The timeline needs revision to:
- Distribute characters across multiple centuries for richer historical depth
- Create mentor-student relationships spanning generations  
- Develop prophecies about characters yet to come
- Establish multi-generational dynasties and bloodlines

Additionally, artifacts need verification against historical counterparts to ensure completeness and authenticity.

## Tasks to Add
1. **Timeline Distribution Task** - Revise character placement for wider temporal spread
2. **Artifact Cross-Reference Task** - Verify character artifacts match historical inspirations
