## Current Task
The user has requested to double-check all fantasy names in "The Crimson Veil" project to ensure we're not using existing copyrighted or well-known fantasy names from established works.

We have a comprehensive epic fantasy project with:
- World name: Vaelthorne (continent)
- 8 major kingdoms/locations with fantasy names
- Lake Crimson as the central supernatural location
- Various character factions and historical references

## Action Plan
1. Review all location names in the project
2. Check kingdom/state names for originality
3. Verify character faction names
4. Research potential conflicts with major fantasy franchises
5. Suggest alternatives if conflicts are found
