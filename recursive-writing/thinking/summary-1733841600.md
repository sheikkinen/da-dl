# Analysis Summary - Philosophical Coverage Gap Analysis

## Current Objective
Analyze whether all planned philosophical figures have been covered in the 22-chapter narrative, identifying any gaps between planned and implemented content.

## Process Plan
1. Review chapter structure and covered philosophers
2. Cross-reference with planning documents for intended coverage
3. Identify uncovered philosophical figures
4. Assess impact on narrative completeness
5. Recommend solutions for coverage gaps

## Self-Reflection
The epilogue suggests systematic completion, but user feedback indicates some philosophers may have been overlooked. Need to verify comprehensive coverage against original planning intentions.
