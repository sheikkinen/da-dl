# Task Summary - Gothic Romance Keyword Research

## Current State
Working on keyword research for the eternal-roses project, focusing on Gothic romance themes within a DeviantArt portfolio. Successfully executed multiple keyword searches and identified relevant artworks.

## Completed Work
1. **Keyword Search Execution**: Successfully ran searches for "romance" (106 results), "passion" (350 results), and "dark" (2,117 results)
2. **Tool Verification**: Confirmed keyword search tool functionality with proper logging and metadata extraction
3. **Category Analysis**: Identified key Gothic romance categories including Dark & Eerie, Heaven and Hell, Erotica, Fantasy, Character & Portrait, and Nature & Animals

## Self Reflection
- The keyword searches provided substantial data about Gothic romance themes in the portfolio
- Large result sets (especially for "dark" themes) indicate rich Gothic content
- Need to analyze patterns and create actionable insights from the search results

## Process Improvements
- Could implement more targeted keyword combinations (e.g., "gothic romance", "dark love")
- May benefit from analyzing temporal patterns in the artwork creation
- Should consider cross-referencing categories to identify strongest Gothic romance indicators

## Next Steps
- Check current state of keyword search tool (user made manual edits)
- Analyze search result patterns for Gothic romance insights
- Document findings for eternal-roses project planning
