## AI Friendly Summary
Creating chapter ending analysis tool to identify verbose endings by counting paragraphs after the last quote in chapters.

## Self Reflection
Building on the 90% completion of Issue #2 (verbose endings), we need a systematic tool to:
1. Identify the last quote in each chapter
2. Count paragraphs following that quote
3. Flag chapters with potentially verbose endings (>3-4 paragraphs)

## Process Improvement Ideas
1. Automate the detection of verbose endings rather than manual review
2. Provide quantitative metrics for "verbosity" assessment
3. Create reusable tool for future chapter analysis

## Current Task
Implement `check-chapter-endings.mjs` tool to analyze paragraph count after last quotes in chapters.
