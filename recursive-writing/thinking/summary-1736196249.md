# Task Summary - January 6, 2025

## Current Task
Create a zsh script to verify that all scenes from the Finnish romance novel "Hearts at Two Seas" are properly included in the complete concatenated version (`hearts-at-two-seas-complete.md`). The script should:
- Take random lines from each scene file
- Grep these lines in the complete novel
- Verify inclusion of all content

## Context
- Novel has 18 chapters across 4 acts (Act 1: Ch 1-5, Act 2A: Ch 6-10, Act 2B: Ch 11-14, Act 3: Ch 15-18)
- Previous QA verification completed with EXCELLENT rating
- Concatenation script already created and run successfully
- Need verification that concatenation didn't miss any content

## Approach
Build a robust verification script that:
1. Locates all scene/chapter files in the narrative structure
2. Samples random lines from each file (avoiding metadata)
3. Searches for these lines in the complete novel
4. Reports any missing content
5. Provides summary statistics

## Files Involved
- Scene files in `/Users/sami.j.p.heikkinen/Documents/src/summer-2025/da-dl/recursive-writing/hearts-at-two-seas/narrative/`
- Complete novel: `/Users/sami.j.p.heikkinen/Documents/src/summer-2025/da-dl/recursive-writing/hearts-at-two-seas/hearts-at-two-seas-complete.md`
- New script: `verify-scenes-inclusion.zsh`
