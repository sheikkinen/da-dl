# Task Summary: Character Template Cross-Check

## Current Status
Cross-checking the basic character template against Lucretia Aurelia Corvina's comprehensive implementation to identify missing elements and best practices.

## Key Observations
- **Template**: Basic structure with essential character elements
- **Implementation**: Rich, detailed profile with advanced documentation features
- **Gap**: Template lacks many sophisticated elements present in the actual character

## Process Improvement Ideas
1. Enhance template with AI-friendly summaries and cross-references
2. Add structured data visualizations (Mermaid diagrams, tables)
3. Include character development tracking mechanisms
4. Incorporate story-specific contextual elements

## Next Steps
1. Analyze differences between template and implementation
2. Update template with missing key elements
3. Ensure template supports comprehensive character development
