# Conversation Summary - Character Renaming Task

## Current Task Status
Revising character renaming strategy for "The Crimson Veil" to eliminate English compound words and use authentic old European language names.

## Problem Identified
The current character mappings in `rename-characters.sh` use English compound words like:
- "Morwyn Ravenshield" (English: raven + shield)
- "Aldric Goldthorn" (English: gold + thorn)  
- "Brennan Stormward" (English: storm + ward)
- "Ragnar Wolfsbane" (English: wolf + bane)

These violate the requirement for authentic old European linguistic roots.

## Solution Required
Replace all compound English names with authentic names from:
- Germanic languages (Old High German, Gothic)
- Latin (Classical Latin forms)
- Celtic languages (Welsh, Gaelic)
- Old Norse
- Anglo-Saxon

Using proper linguistic patterns and etymologies from these historical languages, not modern English constructions.

## Next Steps
1. Update character-renaming-plan.md with authentic old European names
2. Revise rename-characters.sh script with corrected mappings
3. Create new character files with authentic names and etymologies
4. Update all cross-references in planning documents
