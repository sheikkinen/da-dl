# Task Summary - Continuing Philosophical Coverage Analysis

## Current Status
- **Previous Discovery**: Found epilogue factual errors claiming philosophers (Averroes, Eckhart) not actually implemented
- **Implementation Status**: 21/21 planned philosophers successfully covered
- **Critical Issue**: Chapter 22 epilogue contains false claims about encounters

## Next Steps
1. Fix epilogue errors to accurately reflect actual philosophical encounters
2. Cross-check timeline.md for other potential discrepancies
3. Update tasklist with corrections needed

## Process Improvement
- Always verify epilogue/summary claims against actual implementation
- Cross-reference planning documents with final content for accuracy
