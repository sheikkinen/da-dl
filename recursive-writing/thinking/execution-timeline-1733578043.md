# Execution Plan - Timeline Consolidation & Character Factions

## EXECUTING HIGH PRIORITY TASKS

**Current Focus**: Timeline consolidation (Phase 1-4) followed by character faction assignments

**Approach**:
1. Read and analyze existing timeline documents
2. Extract key events and structure from detailed timeline
3. Convert to standardized format for main timeline.md
4. Integrate character assignments and current events
5. Proceed to character-faction assignment with consolidated timeline

**Files to Process**:
- `planning/detailed-historical-timeline.md` (source content)
- `planning/historical-timeline-framework.md` (structure)
- `timeline.md` (destination)
- Character files (for birth dates and events)

Starting with Phase 1: Content Merger
