## FINAL STATE
Both core planning documents (`the-great-war.md` and `world-overview.md`) now fully reflect the 960-year historical timeframe, transforming the story setting from standalone contemporary events to a rich, layered world where current conflicts represent the culmination of nearly a millennium of documented history. All sections connect current events to their historical roots, creating a comprehensive foundation for complex political intrigue and character development rooted in centuries of accumulated grievances and cultural development.

The War of the Crimson Veil is now properly contextualized as a historical convergence point rather than an isolated conflict, with all factions, characters, and locations grounded in specific historical periods and events spanning from the Ancient Era (0-200 AV) through the Current Crisis (958-960 AV).
