## Conflict Template Compliance Analysis

### Template Structure Analysis
**Source:** `shared-artifacts/conflict-template.md`

| Template Section | Required/Optional | Implementation Status |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Conflict Identification | Required | ❓ **Not using template structure** |
| Participants | Required | ❓ **Integrated in other documents** |
| Core Opposition | Required | ❓ **Character-focused approach used** |
| Stakes | Required | ✅ **Well-developed in plot threads** |
| Escalation Points | Required | ✅ **Timeline-integrated escalation** |
| Potential Resolutions | Required | ✅ **War outcomes documented** |
| Character Development | Required | ✅ **Separate character arc files** |

### Implementation Pattern Analysis

#### Alternative Approach Used
Instead of standalone conflict files, conflicts are integrated into:
- **Plot thread files** (succession-crisis.md, diplomatic-breakdown.md)
- **Character arc development** (character-specific conflict tracking)
- **Scene specifications** (conflict per scene documentation)
- **Timeline integration** (conflict escalation over time)

#### Effectiveness Assessment
The distributed approach provides:
- **Better integration** with overall story structure
- **Timeline coordination** of conflict development
- **Character-centric conflict** tracking
- **Scene-level conflict** implementation

#### Template Relevance
The conflict template appears **less applicable** to this story type because:
- **Political intrigue** conflicts are better tracked through plot threads
- **Character conflicts** are better managed in character files
- **Timeline-based escalation** requires different organizational approach

### Recommendations
1. **Evaluate conflict template relevance** for different story types
2. **Consider plot-thread integration** as alternative to standalone conflicts
3. **Develop political intrigue-specific** conflict tracking methods
4. **Update template** to support distributed conflict management

| Plot Template | 85% | Very High | Yes - Add AI enhancements |
| Location Template | 75% | High | Yes - Complete missing sections |
| Conflict Template | 40% | N/A | Yes - Reconsider applicability |

### Key Findings

#### Positive Patterns
1. **Template Enhancement Culture**: Implementations consistently improve upon basic templates
2. **Narrative Quality Focus**: High attention to storytelling quality over rigid compliance
3. **Cultural Integration**: Strong thematic coherence in character development
4. **Cross-Referencing System**: Excellent file interconnection practices

#### Areas for Improvement
