# Task Summary - Executing Timeline and Artifact Tasks

## Current Session Goals
Executing the plan to work on two key tasks for "The Crimson Veil" story development:

1. **Timeline Revision Task**: Redistribute character birth dates across wider timespan (currently concentrated 900-940 AV)
2. **Artifact Verification Task**: Cross-reference character artifacts against historical counterparts

## Context
Previous work established 15 characters with birth dates concentrated in a narrow 40-year period. Need to spread them across multiple centuries to create:
- Multi-generational relationships and mentorship chains
- Historical depth with characters influencing different eras  
- Potential prophecies and legends
- Dynasty and bloodline development

Also need to verify that all character artifacts properly match their historical inspirations' major works.

## Execution Plan
1. **First**: Examine current timeline and character distribution
2. **Then**: Redistribute characters across centuries (700-960 AV span)
3. **Next**: Verify artifact completeness against historical counterparts
4. **Finally**: Update timeline and planning documents

## Files to Work With
- `/timeline.md` - Main timeline to revise
- `/characters/*.md` - Character files to check birth dates
- `/artifacts/*.md` - Artifact files to verify against historical works
- `/story-action-plan.md` - Update task completion status
