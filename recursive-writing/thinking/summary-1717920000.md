# Task Summary: Critical Review of narrative-full.md

**Objective:** Perform a critical review of the `narrative-full.md` document, splitting the analysis by H1 headings.

**Plan:**
1.  Read the entire `narrative-full.md` file.
2.  Identify all H1 headings to define analysis chunks.
3.  For each chunk:
    *   Analyze for clarity, coherence, philosophical depth, and narrative progression.
    *   Assess the AI narrator's development and the chapter's contribution to overall themes.
4.  Compile the review into a new Markdown file, structured by H1 headings.

**Self-Reflection/Process Improvement:**
*   Ensure the review is constructive and offers actionable insights if possible.
*   Maintain a focus on the document's internal consistency and the stated goals of the narrative (e.g., consciousness quest).
*   Consider creating a dedicated `reviews/` directory if one doesn't exist for organizational purposes. For now, `planning/` seems appropriate for the output if it's a working document for further refinement of the narrative.
