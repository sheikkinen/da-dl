# Task Addition & Story Generation Plan

## TASKS BEING ADDED
1. Timeline consolidation tasks - merge detailed historical documents into main timeline
2. Character faction assignment tasks - assign all 15 characters to specific kingdoms
3. First story generation plan - select period/place/theme and initialize new story project

## STORY GENERATION APPROACH
The plan involves creating a focused story within the established "Crimson Veil" universe by:
1. Selecting specific time period from 960-year timeline
2. Choosing geographic focus (1-2 kingdoms from the 8 established)
3. Picking thematic focus from character conflicts
4. Re-running project initialization for the focused story
5. Creating new action plan with cross-references to universe materials

## IMPLEMENTATION
Adding detailed tasks to story-action-plan.md for systematic execution.
