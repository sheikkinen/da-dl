# Session Summary - 1749478260

## AI Friendly Summary
Session continuation: updating issue tracking status after systematic review and editing of 22 narrative chapters in "Discourses with AI" project.

## Self Reflection
Building on previous session achievements, we need to accurately reflect the current completion status:
- Issue #1 (Substrate): 100% complete
- Issue #2 (Verbose Endings): 90% complete  
- Issue #3 (Reference Consistency): Significantly improved from 25% to approximately 75% after fixing critical plot-thread reference errors

## Process Improvement Ideas
1. Update tracking to reflect actual progress made in reference consistency
2. Complete final verification steps for remaining issues
3. Establish clear next steps for reaching 95-100% completion targets

## Current Task
Update issues.md status to accurately reflect progress, particularly the significant improvement in Issue #3 reference consistency.
