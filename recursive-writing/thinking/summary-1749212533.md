2. **Faction Assignment**: Map characters to the 8 kingdom templates for balanced distribution
3. **Relationship Network**: Create conflicts, alliances, and personal connections between characters
4. **Name Convention Expansion**: Develop consistent fantasy naming for Western-inspired characters
5. **Geographic Integration**: Ensure character locations align with kingdom geography and strategic positions

## PROJECT STATUS:
- **Character Development**: 60% complete (15 templates created, 2 fully detailed, 13 to fill)
