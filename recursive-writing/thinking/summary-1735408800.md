# Conversation Summary - December 28, 2024 (Location Reworking)

## TASK DESCRIPTION
Continue with the story development plan by reworking location names to use authentic old European linguistic roots, following the same approach used successfully for character names.

## CONTEXT
Character renaming has been completed with 15 authentic old European names created. Now moving to location name conversion as the next logical step in the development plan. Current location names use English compound words that need replacement with authentic old European linguistic roots.

## CURRENT LOCATIONS TO CONVERT
- Kingdom of Aethermoor → needs Germanic/Latin conversion
- Drakmoor Holds → needs Germanic/Norse conversion  
- Sylvan Courts → needs Celtic/Welsh conversion
- Khanate of Goldenvale → needs Germanic/Latin conversion
- Republic of Westport → needs Latin/Germanic conversion
- March of Stormwind → needs Germanic/Norse conversion
- County of Ravenshollow → needs Germanic/Anglo-Saxon conversion
- Lake Crimson → needs Latin/Celtic conversion

## APPROACH
Use same methodology as character naming:
- Germanic roots (Old High German, Proto-Germanic)
- Latin (Classical and Medieval Latin)
- Celtic/Welsh (Old Welsh, Brythonic)
- Old Norse (for northern/coastal regions)
- Anglo-Saxon (for border regions)
- Maintain phonetic consistency within cultural regions
- Ensure names don't hint at English compound origins

## STATUS
Ready to begin location name conversion process.
