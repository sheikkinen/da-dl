# Task Summary - Check Tools & Create Description Reader

## Current Objective
Check the shared-tools folder for existing functionality to read descriptions by ID from DeviantArt metadata. If no such tool exists, create one.

## Context
- Working on eternal-roses Gothic romance project
- Previous keyword research identified extensive Gothic romance content in DeviantArt data
- Need capability to read specific artwork descriptions by file ID for detailed analysis
- Existing tools include `keyword_search.mjs` for searching by keywords

## Self-Reflection
The keyword research has been productive, identifying 457+ Gothic romance artworks. However, we need granular access to individual descriptions by ID to:
- Examine specific artworks in detail
- Cross-reference findings
- Extract detailed descriptions for thematic analysis
- Support the recursive writing process

## Process Improvement Ideas
- Create modular tools that can be reused across different projects
- Ensure tools follow consistent patterns and interfaces
- Include comprehensive error handling and documentation
- Make tools AI-friendly with clear summaries and cross-references

## Next Steps
1. Examine shared-tools directory structure
2. Search for existing description-by-ID functionality  
3. Create tool if missing
4. Test new tool functionality
5. Continue Gothic romance keyword research using new capabilities
