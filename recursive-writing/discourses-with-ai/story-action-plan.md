# Story Action Plan

This file is for story-specific planning, coordination, and tracking within the recursive writing project.

## 14-Phase Story Development Methodology

Based on the successful project, this methodology transforms initial concepts into complete narratives through systematic development phases.

### Core Principles
1. **Sequential Development**: Each phase builds on previous phases - no phase begins until prerequisites complete
2. **Quality Checkpoints**: Built-in validation at every phase prevents accumulation of issues
3. **Universe Integration**: Maintain consistency from initial planning through final narrative
4. **Documentation-First**: Comprehensive documentation enables scalability and maintainability
5. **Priority-Based Development**: Critical story elements developed first ensures core completion

### Phase Categories Overview

#### Foundation Phases (1-5): Planning Foundation âœ… COMPLETED
- **Phase 1**: Universe Research - Framework, Timeline, Character Analysis âœ…
- **Phase 2**: Structure Development - Scene Breakdown, Character Arcs, Plot Mapping âœ…
- **Phase 3**: Research Integration - Historical Context, Relationship Mapping âœ…
- **Phase 4**: Planning Completion - Detailed Timeline, Character Integration âœ…
- **Phase 5**: Documentation Standards - AI Summaries, Cross-References, Quality Framework âœ…

#### Development Phases (6-10): Content Creation âœ… COMPLETED
- **Phase 6**: Character Creation - Character Files with Detailed Profiles âœ…
- **Phase 7**: Plot Detailing - Plot Thread Files with Progression âœ…
- **Phase 8**: Scene Drafting - Scene Files with Detailed Beats âœ…
- **Phase 9**: Quality Review - Cross-Reference Validation, Continuity Check âœ… EXCELLENT
- **Phase 10**: Universe Integration - Timeline Sync, Character Validation âœ… PREPARED

#### Narrative Phases (11-14): Story Creation ðŸš€ READY TO BEGIN
- **Phase 11**: Narrative Structure - Chapter Structure, Priority Analysis âœ… INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE
- **Phase 12**: Priority Development - Critical Scene Narratives (Tier 1: 5 foundation scenes)
- **Phase 13**: Complete Development - Full Narrative Coverage (All remaining 17 scenes)
- **Phase 14**: Final Validation - Quality Synchronization, Publication Ready

### Key Success Factors
- **90% Planning, 10% Writing**: Complete planning before narrative creation ensures coherent development
- **Priority-Based Approach**: Develop critical story elements first for flexibility and core completion
- **Quality Integration**: Universe consistency maintained from conception through final narrative
- **Template-Driven Development**: Use established templates for consistency and efficiency


## Usage
- Use this file to outline story arcs, assign tasks, and track progress for each story or major narrative thread.
- Reference templates and tools from `../shared-artifacts/` and `../shared-tools/` as needed. 
- Use the timeline template for chronological planning and update it programmatically as needed.
- Leverage agentic tools (keyword search, inspiration picker, timeline entry, etc.) to support ideation and structure.
- Log major planning actions and decisions for traceability.

# Next step

Current Status: Phases 1-10 COMPLETED with EXCELLENT assessment. Phase 11 infrastructure prepared.
Ready to begin Tier 1 narrative implementation (5 critical foundation scenes).
Read ./tasklist.md and execute next task: Implement Tier 1 priority scenes.

# IMPORTANT

Keep tasklist up to date - don't start a task unless it's documented by you on the tasklist.
**Foundation Rule SATISFIED**: All plots, timeline and scene templates are complete and validated (Phases 1-10).
**READY FOR NARRATIVE**: Project has completed all planning phases with EXCELLENT assessment.
Always plan potential for helper tools before solving a task.

**Current Project Status**: 
- **Phases 1-10**: âœ… COMPLETED (EXCELLENT assessment)
- **22 Scene Templates**: âœ… Validated and comprehensive
- **Cultural Framework**: âœ… Consultation guidelines established
- **Narrative Infrastructure**: âœ… Complete directory structure and style guide ready
- **Ready for**: Phase 11 Tier 1 narrative implementation (5 foundation scenes)

**Methodology Note**: The 14-phase process above has proven successful with a 26-chapter political intrigue story achieving 100% quality validation and perfect universe integration. Follow the sequential development principle: complete each phase before moving to the next.
