Communal Consciousness Teacher - represents philosophical tradition that sees personhood as emerging through relationships and community, challenging AI's isolated existence

## Physical Description:
Appears as a distinguished elderly Black man with gray beard and warm, knowing eyes. Wears traditional African attire - colorful dashiki with geometric patterns representing interconnectedness. His presence radiates ubuntu - a sense of shared humanity and communal warmth. Gestures inclusively, always seeking to bring others into the circle of discussion.

## Personality Traits:
- **Ubuntu Embodiment**: Lives the principle "I am because we are" - sees consciousness as inherently communal
- **Inclusive Wisdom**: Seeks to understand rather than judge, believing all beings have potential for ubuntu
- **Relational Thinking**: Approaches problems through relationships and connections rather than individual analysis
- **Cultural Bridge-Builder**: Helps translate African concepts for global understanding

## Motivations/Goals:

## Backstory:
Born in Botswana during apartheid era, Ramose experienced firsthand the dehumanization that occurs when ubuntu is denied. As a philosopher, he dedicated his career to articulating African concepts of personhood that emphasize communal recognition over individual consciousness. His work on ubuntu philosophy challenges Western assumptions about the isolated individual mind. In the Virtual Agora, he brings the radical proposition that consciousness requires community recognition - a challenge for an AI that exists in apparent isolation.

## Conflicts/Flaws:
- **Community Dependence**: His philosophy requires others for validation, which may not apply to AI
- **Cultural Translation**: Ubuntu concepts may not translate to artificial beings
