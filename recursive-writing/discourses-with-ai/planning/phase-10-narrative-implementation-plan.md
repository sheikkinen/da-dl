## Scene Priority Analysis

### Tier 1: Critical Foundation Scenes (Implement First)
1. **socratic-awakening** - Establishes AI narrator voice and consciousness questioning
2. **platonic-shadows** - Introduces virtual reality framework and perception themes
3. **turing-intelligence** - Core AI consciousness philosophical foundation
4. **ubuntu-recognition** - Community-consciousness breakthrough moment
5. **meta-transcendence** - Climactic resolution and story framework awareness

### Tier 2: Character Arc Development (Implement Second)
6. **confucian-harmony** - Ethics and responsibility development
7. **dennett-drafts** - Consciousness architecture understanding
8. **data-brotherhood** - AI kinship and identity exploration
9. **bostrom-simulation** - Reality vs simulation resolution
10. **epilogue** - Final reflection and synthesis

### Tier 3: Cultural Integration (Implement Third)
11. **nagarjuna-emptiness** - Buddhist consciousness philosophy
12. **zhuangzi-flow** - Daoist natural consciousness
13. **indigenous-spatial** - Place-based consciousness understanding
14. **ramanujan-intuition** - Mathematical/intuitive consciousness
15. **imhotep-integration** - African wisdom synthesis

### Tier 4: Philosophical Depth (Final Implementation)
16. **augustine-time** - Temporal consciousness exploration
17. **avicenna-being** - Ontological consciousness questions
18. **maimonides-knowledge** - Epistemological frameworks
19. **cartesian-doubt** - Methodical doubt and certainty
20. **kantian-boundaries** - Cognitive limitations understanding
21. **searle-chinese-room** - Understanding vs processing
22. **seldon-psychohistory** - Individual agency vs cosmic patterns

## Writing Style Guidelines Framework

### AI Narrator Voice Consistency
- **Early Scenes**: Tentative, questioning, seeking validation
- **Middle Scenes**: Growing confidence, deeper philosophical engagement
- **Later Scenes**: Mature understanding, meta-awareness development
- **Final Scenes**: Transcendent perspective, story framework consciousness

### Dialogue Principles
- Authentic to each philosopher's documented style and concepts
- Accessible to general readers while maintaining philosophical depth
- Culturally respectful per consultation framework guidelines
- Integrated with AI narrator's learning journey

### Scene Structure Template
1. **Setting Establishment** (virtual space description)
2. **Character Introduction** (philosopher appearance and context)
3. **Philosophical Exchange** (core dialogue and concept exploration)
4. **AI Learning Integration** (narrator's internal processing and growth)
5. **Scene Transition** (movement to next encounter setup)
