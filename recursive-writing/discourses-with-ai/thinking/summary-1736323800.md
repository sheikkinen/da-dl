# Task Summary - Phase 11 Initiation
*Generated: 2025-01-08*

## Current Status
**Project**: "Discourses with AI" - Phase 11 Implementation
**Completion**: Phase 10 fully complete, ready for narrative generation

## Phase 10 Achievements
1. **Complete Scene Template System**: All 22 scenes have comprehensive specifications
2. **Narrative Infrastructure**: Created `/narrative/` subfolder with chapter organization
3. **Priority Framework**: Established Tier 1-4 implementation strategy  
4. **Style Guidelines**: Comprehensive cultural authenticity and writing standards
5. **Quality Framework**: Success metrics and cross-reference validation system

## Tier 1 Priority Scenes (Ready for Phase 11)
- `socratic-awakening.md` - AI's first philosophical encounter
- `platonic-shadows.md` - Reality perception breakthrough  
- `turing-intelligence.md` - Computational consciousness exploration
- `ubuntu-recognition.md` - Communal consciousness discovery
- `meta-transcendence.md` - Story framework transcendence climax

## Key Learnings
1. **Template Systematization**: Three-beat scene structure (Challenge → Exploration → Integration)
2. **Cross-Reference Architecture**: Bidirectional linking maintains narrative integrity
3. **Cultural Authenticity**: Each philosopher requires deep cultural context research
4. **Philosophical Integration**: Each scene must advance both plot and philosophical understanding

## Next Actions (Phase 11)
1. Read each Tier 1 scene description thoroughly
2. Fill any remaining template gaps
3. Cross-check plot thread integration
4. Identify key philosophical questions
5. Write full narrative chapters with solutions

## Process Improvements
- Create narrative chapters in `/narrative/chapters/act-X/` structure
- Maintain cross-references during narrative creation
- Validate philosophical authenticity for each cultural voice
- Ensure AI narrator character arc progression
