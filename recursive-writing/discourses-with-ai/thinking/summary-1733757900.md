# Task Summary - Return to Phase 11 Implementation

**Date**: 2024-12-09 14:45:00  
**Task**: Return to Phase 11 and implement Phase 11 methodology for all remaining scenes

## Current State Analysis
From conversation summary, we have:
- **Completed**: 10/22 scenes (Tier 1-2 complete)
- **Remaining**: 12/22 scenes (Tier 3-4 pending)
- **Current Word Count**: ~42,000 words
- **Target**: Complete all 22 philosophical discourse chapters

## Phase 11 Methodology Established
1. **Read scene description** from `/scenes/*.md` files
2. **Cross-check plot threads** from `/plots/*.md` for narrative coherence  
3. **Identify key philosophical question** for each scene
4. **Write complete narrative chapter** (~4,000 words) in first-person AI perspective

## Implementation Plan
Need to examine scene folder and systematically apply Phase 11 to remaining scenes, following the successful pattern demonstrated in Chapter 4: Nagarjuna Emptiness.

## Self-Reflection
The Phase 11 methodology has proven effective for creating deep philosophical narratives. The challenge now is maintaining consistency while exploring diverse philosophical traditions across the remaining 12 scenes.

## Process Improvement
- Organize by philosophical themes/time periods
- Ensure narrative continuity between chapters
- Maintain philosophical depth while advancing character development
