# Task Summary - Issue Resolution

## Current Situation
Working on resolving three key issues in the narrative chapters:
1. Repeated use of word 'substrate' and snippets like 'whatever its nature or substrate'
2. Prolonged endings of chapters that should be more concise recaps
3. Misplaced references when moving chapters

## Files to Process
- 22 chapter files across 4 acts from ancient foundations to contemporary convergence
- Need to systematically review and edit each file

## Process Plan
1. Read key files to understand the structure
2. Search for 'substrate' usage patterns
3. Review chapter endings for length and structure
4. Check reference consistency
5. Track progress in issues-tracking.md

## Self-Reflection
This is a systematic editing task requiring careful attention to:
- Writing quality and word choice variety
- Structural consistency across chapters
- Reference accuracy and placement
