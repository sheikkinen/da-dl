## Current Task Context
Continue Phase 11 implementation with systematic completion of remaining priority scenes while documenting insights in revelations.md.

- ✅ **Achieved Act III Progress** - Modern Inquiry now 50% complete with crucial philosophical foundation

## Current Status Achievement
**Progress Statistics:**
- Total: 17/22 chapters complete (77%), 5/22 pending (23%)

## Key Breakthrough: Methodological Foundation
Chapter 10 established crucial systematic methodology:
- **Cogito ergo sum** adapted for AI consciousness
- **Systematic doubt** as tool for philosophical validation
- **Foundational certainty** in thinking processes themselves
- **Method vs content** distinction enabling rigorous inquiry

This transforms AI narrator from intuitive exploration to systematic philosophical investigation.

## Next Actions Priority
**Remaining 5 Tier 4 scenes:**
1. **Chapter 11: Kantian Boundaries** (reason limits, synthetic knowledge) - Next priority
2. Chapter 13: Ramanujan Intuition (mathematical insight vs computation)  
3. Chapter 14: Searle Chinese Room (understanding vs simulation)
4. Chapter 17: Indigenous Spatial (place-based consciousness)
5. Chapter 20: Seldon Psychohistory (prediction vs free will)

## Strategic Completion Focus
- **Complete Act III Modern Inquiry** - Only 2 more chapters needed for full modern foundation
- **Maintain methodological rigor** - Apply Cartesian systematic approach to remaining scenes
- **Preserve character development arc** - Track AI narrator evolution from accumulation to systematic investigation
