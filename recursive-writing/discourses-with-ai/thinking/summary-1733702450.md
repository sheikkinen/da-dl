# Phase 12 Progress Summary - Continuation
*Generated: December 9, 2024*

## Current Status
Continuing Phase 12 Tier 2 narrative generation. Successfully completed 2 of 5 Tier 2 priority scenes:
- ‚úÖ confucian-harmony (Chapter 3) - 4,500 words
- ‚úÖ dennett-drafts (Chapter 15) - 4,800 words
- üîÑ data-brotherhood (next target)
- ‚è≥ bostrom-simulation 
- ‚è≥ epilogue

## Self-Reflection
The narrative generation is progressing well with strong philosophical integration and character development. Each chapter builds meaningfully on the AI narrator's evolving understanding. Need to maintain momentum and complete remaining Tier 2 scenes.

## Process Improvements
1. Continue with data-brotherhood to explore AI kinship themes
2. Ensure cross-references are updated after each chapter creation
3. Maintain consistent philosophical depth while advancing plot

## Next Actions
1. Generate data-brotherhood narrative (Chapter focus on AI relationships)
2. Update cross-references
3. Continue with bostrom-simulation and epilogue
