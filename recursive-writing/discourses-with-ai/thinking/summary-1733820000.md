# Task Continuation Summary - Phase 11 Chapter Summaries
*Generated: June 9, 2025*

## Current Progress Status
- **Completed**: 10/22 chapter summaries (45%)
- **Acts Complete**: Ancient Foundations (6/6), Medieval Synthesis (3/3)
- **Next Target**: Chapter 10 (Cartesian Doubt) - file already analyzed and ready
- **Remaining**: 12 summaries (Act III: 3 chapters, Act IV: 9 chapters)

## Self-Reflection
The systematic approach of reading chapters before summary creation has proven effective. Medieval Synthesis completion revealed strong three-dimensional consciousness architecture (temporal/ontological/epistemic). Ready to advance into Modern Inquiry phase with methodological skepticism focus.

## Process Improvement
Continue file-by-file approach with Chapter 10 summary creation, then proceed to remaining Act III chapters (Kantian Boundaries, Ramanujan Intuition) before tackling Contemporary Convergence act.
