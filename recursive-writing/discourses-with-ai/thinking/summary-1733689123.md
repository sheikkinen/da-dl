# Task Summary - Scene Template Completion Review

**Date**: December 8, 2024 (Timestamp: 1733689123)

## Current Objective
Review all 22 scene templates for incomplete information and fill in missing content to prepare for Phase 11 Tier 1 narrative implementation.

## Self Reflection
Based on the conversation summary, all scene templates exist but may be in template format rather than fully specified. Need systematic review to identify gaps and complete specifications before narrative writing can begin.

## Process Improvement Ideas
1. Create standardized template completion checklist
2. Batch review all scenes for consistency
3. Prioritize Tier 1 scenes for immediate completion
4. Establish quality validation for template completeness

## Expected Outcomes
- Complete scene specifications for all 22 scenes
- Ready-to-implement templates for Tier 1 priority scenes
- Clear foundation for Phase 11 narrative development
