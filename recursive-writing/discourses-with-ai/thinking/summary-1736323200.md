# Task Summary - Scene Template Completion

## Conversation Summary
The "Discourses with AI" project has completed Phases 1-10 with EXCELLENT assessment and is ready for Phase 11 Tier 1 narrative implementation. However, scene templates contain placeholder text that needs completion before actual narrative writing can begin.

## Progress Analysis
- **COMPLETED**: 5 Tier 1 priority scenes already have full specifications
- **PENDING**: ~17 Tier 2-4 scenes contain placeholder text requiring completion
- **TOOL STRATEGY**: Use grep_search to identify incomplete patterns, then systematically complete each template

## Self-Reflection
Previous session successfully identified the scope but didn't complete the systematic filling. Need to focus on:
1. Consistent template structure following ubuntu-recognition.md example
2. Cross-reference integrity between files
3. Quality validation of completed specifications

## Process Improvement Ideas
- Batch process scenes by tier priority
- Use pattern matching to identify all placeholder types
- Validate cross-references after completion
- Ensure AI Friendly summaries are included in each file

## Next Actions
1. Identify all incomplete scene templates
2. Systematically complete missing information
3. Validate cross-reference consistency
4. Prepare for Phase 11 narrative implementation
