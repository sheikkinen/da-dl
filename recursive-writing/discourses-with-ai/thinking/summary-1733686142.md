## Process Improvement Learnings

### Template-First Development Success
- **Discovery**: Creating comprehensive templates before narrative content proved highly effective
- **Benefit**: Ensures consistency and universe integration from start
- **Application**: Recommend template-first approach for complex multi-scene projects

### Quality Review Timing Optimization
- **Discovery**: Conducting quality review after template completion but before narrative writing optimal
- **Benefit**: Identifies issues early when fixes are less complex
- **Application**: Build quality checkpoints into project timeline

### Collaborative AI-Human Methodology
- **Discovery**: AI excels at consistency validation and pattern recognition
- **Discovery**: Human provides creative vision and cultural sensitivity guidance
- **Application**: Leverage AI for systematic validation, human for creative direction

## Cultural Representation Framework
