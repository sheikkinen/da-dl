# Recursive Writing Project: Status & Next Steps

## Status Summary (as of 2025-06-05)

### Project Setup
- All directories, templates, and shared tools are in place.
- Story initialization (`init-story.zsh`) is robust, agentic, and logs actions.
- Shared templates (character, scene, plot, artifact, timeline) are accessible and referenced in new stories.

### Tooling
- Core agentic tools implemented and tested:
  - Story initialization
  - Keyword search
  - Random inspiration picker
  - Theme/category explorer
  - Timeline/chronology tool (with programmatic update support)
- All tools use the active story context and log actions.
- Automated test script (`test-run.zsh`) covers all implemented tools, including timeline entry automation.

### Documentation & Planning
- Action plan and tool brainstorm documents are up to date.
- Timeline template is streamlined for automation.

## Analysis: Strengths & Gaps
- **Strengths:**
  - Modular, agentic, and testable tooling foundation.
  - Logging and active-story context ensure traceability and reproducibility.
  - Timeline and inspiration mining workflows are ready for creative use.
- **Gaps:**
  - Some creative and cross-referencing tools are not yet implemented (see below).
  - Story development and mining workflows are not yet automated.
  - No automated logging utility for non-tool actions.

## Proposed Next Steps

### 1. Tooling
- [ ] Implement story seed extractor (from metadata_index.jsonl or other sources)
- [ ] Build image/description pair exporter
- [ ] Create scene creation tool (using templates and inspiration mining)
- [ ] Develop cross-referencing tool (linking characters, scenes, artifacts, etc.)
- [ ] Add a general logging utility for manual/agentic actions

### 2. Story Development Preparation
- [ ] Brainstorm and document action-oriented scenes
- [ ] Review and enhance world-building for "grit" and realism
- [ ] Document concrete approaches for action/grit in scenes

### 3. Inspiration Mining & Elaboration
- [ ] Set up and document grep/alternative search for dataset mining
- [ ] Automate extraction of character profiles, artifacts, locations, plot threads, and scenes
- [ ] Outline and automate chapter structure and narrative web mapping

### 4. Quality, Review, and Tracking
- [ ] Establish a checklist for updating related docs when a primary doc changes
- [ ] Schedule review sessions and document iterative principles
- [ ] Define measurable targets and set up progress tracking

---

**Focus:** Prioritize agentic, testable tools that support recursive, creative workflows. Continue to automate and document every step for maximum reproducibility and creative leverage.
