## Plot Summary

### Supernatural Emergency
Romeo awakens to a sharp, predatory disturbance—the first true test of their guardian purpose. Elena Montague is in supernatural danger, threatened by something that feeds on her despair and connection to Romeo and Juliet's tragic history.

### The Threat Identified
They identify the entity as a Despair Feeder, a creature that twists love into suffering and feeds on the pain of broken bonds. It forces Elena to experience Romeo and Juliet's deaths as if they were happening to her, draining her life force through induced anguish.

### Breaking Non-Interference
For the first time in five centuries, Romeo and Juliet break their policy of passive observation. They race through a storm-lashed city to the university campus, where Elena conducts her research surrounded by dangerous historical documents.

### Infiltration Mission
They navigate modern security systems using supernatural abilities—Juliet manipulates shadows to disable cameras while Romeo tracks patrol routes. The Gothic university provides atmospheric cover for their supernatural presence.

### Confronting the Entity
In the rare books section, they find Elena collapsed among scattered papers, being drained by the writhing mass of darkness that is the Despair Feeder. The creature has been forcing her to relive Romeo and Juliet's deaths, growing stronger with each wave of induced despair.

### Love vs. Despair Battle
The Despair Feeder attempts to use Romeo and Juliet's tragic origins against them, claiming they are creatures of tragedy sustained by the very despair it cultivates. However, their combined presence creates golden radiance—the light of love fulfilled and transcendent.

### Victory Through Transcendence
Romeo and Juliet prove that their story is ultimately about triumph, not tragedy. Their love conquered death and transformed suffering into eternal joy. This truth becomes a weapon against the Despair Feeder, banishing the entity and freeing Elena.

### Elena's Awakening
Elena recovers from the supernatural influence with a new understanding of love's power. Romeo's final words guide her toward seeing family history as stories of triumph rather than tragedy, protecting her from future supernatural threats.

### New Purpose Accepted
Romeo and Juliet acknowledge their fundamental transformation from private lovers to cosmic guardians. They accept that their existence now requires active protection of love itself, not just their personal bond.
