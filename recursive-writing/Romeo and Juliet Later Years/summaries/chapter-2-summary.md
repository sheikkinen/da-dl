## Plot Summary

### Sensing Danger
Juliet arrives at the Eternal Garden but senses a disturbanceâ€”a living person moving through the cemetery. She detects Elena Montague, a 16-year-old descendant, conducting genealogical research among the family graves with flashlight and historical documents.

### The Near Discovery
Elena systematically searches for Romeo's original tomb, armed with family records dating back centuries. She approaches within twenty feet of Romeo's actual resting place, asking dangerous questions about where Romeo Montague was buried in 1597.

### Strategic Intervention
Romeo joins Juliet in observing their descendant. They realize Elena's academic thoroughness poses an unprecedented threat to their secret existence. Juliet orchestrates a supernatural misdirection, manifesting as a ghostly apparition to guide Elena away from Romeo's tomb toward safer research topics.

### Protective Deception
The supernatural intervention successfully redirects Elena's attention. A mysterious wind scatters her papers, and she encounters what she believes to be a family ghost pointing her toward a different section of the cemetery. She leaves convinced she's experienced something supernatural but non-threatening.

### New Responsibilities
Romeo and Juliet realize their passive approach to descendant protection is no longer sufficient. They discuss the need for more active surveillance and management of bloodline families. The modern world's technology and investigative methods create new challenges to their secrecy.

### Planning and Adaptation
Their reunion becomes a strategy session rather than purely romantic time. They acknowledge that their guardian duties require evolution and that they may need to reach out to other supernatural families for coordinated protection efforts.
