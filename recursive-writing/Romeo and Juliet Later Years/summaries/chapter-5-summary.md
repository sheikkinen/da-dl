## Plot Summary

### Cosmic Summons
Romeo awakens to a profound cosmic invitation—deeper than their usual reunion call or supernatural emergencies. He feels summoned to cathedral ruins from the twelfth century, a place where lovers have pledged their hearts for centuries and prayers for true love have been offered since before their mortal births.

### The Sacred Journey
Romeo and Juliet travel together across countryside that remains unchanged from their mortal era, leaving behind modern Verona for olive groves and cypress trees under a star-filled sky. The night itself feels different—stars brighter, patterns more meaningful, as if celestial bodies align to witness their revelation.

### The Ancient Sacred Site
They arrive at magnificent cathedral ruins transformed by time into something more mystical than any intact building. Broken walls suggest soaring arches, scattered colored glass lies like jewels among ancient stones, and the collapsed dome creates a natural amphitheater for cosmic encounter.

### Meeting the Weaver
At the heart of the ruins, where the altar once stood, they encounter the Weaver—a cosmic entity shifting between starlight and luminescent shadow. This being possesses vast age and infinite wisdom, appearing sometimes corporeal, sometimes ethereal, but always magnificent.

### The Network of Love Revealed
The Weaver reveals the ultimate truth: Romeo and Juliet are part of a global Network of Love, shown as points of light across a world map representing locations where love has triumphed over death. Each light represents Love-Bonded Eternals—couples whose bonds proved stronger than any force attempting to break them.

### Universal Guardians
They learn they are not unique but part of something grander—Love-Bonded Eternals exist in every age and culture where love has been valued above life itself. Examples include ancient Egyptian lovers entombed together, Japanese couples choosing shared death over separation, and Victorian spouses whose grief-driven deaths led to joint resurrection.

### Experiential Connection
Through the Weaver's power, Romeo and Juliet briefly connect with other eternal couples across time and space, experiencing the desert love of Egyptian guardians, the refined passion of Heian court lovers, and the industrial-age determination of Victorian eternals.

### Purpose Clarification
Their cosmic role is revealed: they are guardians not just of their own love, but of love itself as a universal force. When despair spreads and darkness threatens to convince the world that love is weakness, they counter that darkness with living proof of love's transcendent power.

### Transformative Understanding
Romeo and Juliet experience spiritual transformation—their personal bond expanding to encompass universal service. Their nightly resurrection serves as contribution to maintaining love's presence in the world, with every moment of joy sending strengthening ripples through the global network.

### Eternal Mission Accepted
They embrace their role as Love's eternal guardians, understanding that their romance now serves purposes stretching across the globe and through centuries. Their love story has become part of a magnificent, ancient, ongoing network ensuring no heart is ever entirely alone in its devotion.
