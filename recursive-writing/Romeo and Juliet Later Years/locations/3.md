## Type/Category:
Ancient Family Cemetery / Supernatural Memorial Ground

## Geographic Description:
Located on a hill overlooking Verona, the Montague family cemetery spans several acres of hallowed ground dating back centuries.

The cemetery maintains its Renaissance-era layout but has grown to accommodate modern Montague descendants, creating a bridge between Romeo's living era and the present day.

## Current State/Condition:
Well-maintained by living family members but holding supernatural resonance during nighttime hours. The older sections, particularly around Romeo's original burial site, emanate spiritual energy. Modern sections remain normal during day but take on ethereal quality during Romeo's undead hours, when ancestral spirits become visible and communicative.
