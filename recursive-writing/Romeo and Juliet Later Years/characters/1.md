## Role/Archetype:
Tragic Romantic Hero transformed into Supernatural Lover. Romeo embodies eternal devotion that transcends death itself, serving as both the passionate pursuer and protective guardian in their undead romance. His archetype bridges classical tragic lover with gothic supernatural entity.

## Physical Description:
Romeo appears as he did at death - a handsome young man of approximately 17-18 years, but with ethereal undead qualities. His olive skin holds a pale, moonlit luminescence that becomes more pronounced in darkness. Dark hair falls in Renaissance curls, occasionally stirring without wind. His eyes retain their original brown warmth but now hold flecks of otherworldly silver that gleam in moonlight. 

He dresses in period-appropriate noble attire that appears pristine despite centuries - a burgundy doublet with Montague family crest, black hose, and a cloak that seems to move with supernatural grace. His movements carry both youthful passion and centuries of accumulated wisdom. When emotional, faint traces of his death wounds may briefly appear before fading.

## Personality Traits:
- **Eternal Passion**: Romeo's love burns as intensely as in life, now amplified by supernatural longing and the knowledge that their love literally conquered death
- **Protective Devotion**: Centuries of undead existence have transformed his impulsiveness into fierce protectiveness over Juliet and their sacred bond
- **Melancholic Wisdom**: While retaining youthful emotional intensity, Romeo has gained deep understanding of love, loss, and the burden of eternal existence
- **Secretive Nature**: His undead state requires constant vigilance to hide from the living world, creating layers of necessary deception

## Motivations/Goals:
- **Primary**: Preserve and nurture his eternal bond with Juliet through nightly resurrections and secret meetings
- **Secondary**: Protect their undead existence from discovery by mortals who would fear or seek to destroy them
- **Personal**: Find meaning and purpose in their curse/blessing beyond mere existence - perhaps helping other tragic lovers
- **Hidden**: Secretly researches ways to either become fully alive again or help Juliet achieve peace if she desires release

## Key Relationships:
- **Juliet Capulet (Undead)**: Eternal soulmate and fellow undead being. Their bond transcends the original family feud and now represents the ultimate triumph of love over death. They share synchronized resurrection cycles and supernatural connection
- **Capulet and Montague Descendants**: Living family members remain unaware of their undead ancestors. Romeo observes his bloodline with protective interest while maintaining absolute secrecy
- **Father Lawrence's Spirit**: Occasional contact with the ghost of Friar Lawrence, who blessed their original union and now serves as spiritual guide for their undead existence
- **Other Undead**: Rare encounters with other supernatural beings who recognize their unique nature as love-bound undead rather than cursed or vengeful spirits
- **Verona Nocturna**: Deep connection to the nighttime supernatural realm of their city, including guardian spirits of sacred places

## Backstory:
Romeo died by poison in the Capulet tomb believing Juliet was truly dead, fulfilling the tragic arc of Shakespeare's original. However, their love proved so pure and powerful that death could not contain it. Through divine intervention or natural supernatural law, both lovers rise each night as undead beings, bound together by their eternal vows.

Over the centuries since their deaths (circa 1600s), Romeo has experienced the full weight of immortal existence. He witnessed Verona's changes through history while remaining hidden in shadows and crypts. The family feud that once separated them became meaningless as both houses evolved, and their descendants live normal mortal lives unaware of their undead ancestors.

Romeo learned to master his undead nature - understanding the resurrection cycle, developing supernatural senses, and discovering their ability to exist in a liminal space between life and death. His greatest trial was learning patience, as his passionate nature initially made their eternal secrecy challenging. Now he serves as both romantic partner and protective guardian of their sacred bond.

The transformation deepened his understanding of love's true power. Where once he loved with youthful abandon, now he loves with the wisdom of centuries and the knowledge that their bond literally transcends the fundamental law of mortality. This makes every nightly reunion both familiar and miraculous.

## Conflicts/Flaws:
- **Internal Conflict**: Struggles with the burden of immortality and the question of whether their undead existence serves a greater purpose or merely prolongs suffering
- **External Conflict**: Must constantly hide their existence from mortal descendants while feeling responsible for protecting the Montague bloodline
- **Character Flaws**: Retains impulsive nature from his youth, sometimes acting rashly to protect Juliet without considering consequences; prone to melancholy when contemplating infinite existence
- **Moral Dilemmas**: Questions whether interfering in descendants' lives to help them is justified; debates whether to reveal their existence to ease others' suffering from loss
- **Vulnerabilities**: Extreme dependency on Juliet's presence for emotional stability; sunrise separation causes deep anguish; vulnerable to despair if their love's purpose is questioned
