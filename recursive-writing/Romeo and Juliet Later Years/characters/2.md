## Backstory:
Juliet died by Romeo's dagger upon awakening to find him poisoned beside her, completing the tragic cycle of Shakespeare's original tale. However, their love proved so pure and transcendent that death became merely a transition rather than an ending. Divine grace or natural supernatural law caused both lovers to rise as undead beings, eternally bound by their wedding vows.

Throughout the centuries since their deaths, Juliet has grown from a desperate young woman into a wise and mystical being. She witnessed the world's changes through history while learning to master her undead nature. Where Romeo struggled with patience, Juliet struggled with the weight of infinite time and the fear that their love might fade across eternity.

She discovered their resurrection cycle follows lunar patterns and their love itself generates the supernatural energy sustaining their existence. Juliet learned to find beauty in their nocturnal world and developed deep spiritual understanding of love's power to transcend fundamental laws of reality.

Her greatest growth was learning that their undead state isn't punishment but a sacred gift - they serve as living proof that true love can literally conquer death. This realization transformed her perspective from tragic victim to mystical guardian of eternal love's greatest triumph.
