- Adjust strategy if momentum stalls
- Consider strategic withdrawal if no reciprocation

### The One-Month Decision Point

- Make commitment push or graceful exit
- Avoid indefinite "talking" phase

### The Three-Month Milestone
- Traditional relationship establishment point
- Either committed relationship or honest reassessment
- Long-term compatibility evaluation

### Social Circle Campaign (Mutual Friends)
- **Advantage**: Built-in social proof and safety
- **Timeline**: Often accelerated due to trust transfer
- **Risk**: Social consequences of failure

### Cold Approach Campaign (Bar/Coffee Shop)
- **Advantage**: Pure attraction-based connection
- **Timeline**: Faster initial chemistry assessment
- **Risk**: Higher rejection rate, no social context

### Workplace Campaign (DANGER ZONE)
- **Extreme Caution Required**
- **Extended Timeline**: Much slower due to professional considerations
- **High Stakes**: Career implications of failure
