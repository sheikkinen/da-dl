## Chapter I: Opening Gambits

### Tinder Openers (By Sunzi's Principles)

**The Reconnaissance Approach:**
- "I see you're into [specific interest]. What got you started with that?"
- "Your photo at [location] - was that as amazing as it looks?"
- "I have to ask about [unique detail in bio]..."

**The Unexpected Flanking Maneuver:**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how tired are you of guys asking about your weekend plans?"
- "I'm going to guess you're either a secret agent or a kindergarten teacher."
- "Your [pet/hobby] looks like they have strong opinions about everything."

**The Strategic Compliment:**
- Focus on choices, not genetics: "Great taste in books/music/travel spots"
- Observe effort: "That photo perfectly captures the energy of the place"
- Notice uniqueness: "I've never seen someone make [activity] look so natural"

### Bar/Social Approaches

**The Environmental Gambit:**
```
Situation: Crowded bar, she's waiting for drinks
Approach: "The bartender's playing favorites - been here long?"
Follow-up: "I'm [name], and I'm convinced there's a secret handshake I don't know"
```

**The Observational Opening:**
```
Situation: Bookstore/coffee shop
Approach: "I'm trying to decide between [two books]. You look like someone with good judgment"
Follow-up: "I'm [name]. Are you team [option A] or [option B]?"
```

**The Social Proof Play:**
```
Situation: Party/social event
Approach: "Sarah mentioned you're the person to ask about [her interest]"
Follow-up: "I'm [name], and apparently I need an expert consultation"
```

- "If you could only eat one cuisine for the rest of your life, what would it be?"
- "What's the best advice you've ever received?"

**Level 3 - Emotional Intel:**
- "What's been the highlight of your week?"
- "What's something you believed as a kid that turned out to be completely wrong?"
- "If you could have dinner with anyone, living or dead, who would it be?"

## Chapter III: Digital Warfare Tactics

### Text Message Strategy

**The Opening Phase:**
```
Instead of: "Hey"
Use: "Question: [specific reference to your last conversation]"
```

**The Rapport Building Phase:**
```
Instead of: "How was your day?"
Use: "Did you survive [specific thing they mentioned]?"
```

**The Escalation Phase:**
```
Instead of: "Want to hang out?"
Use: "I found the perfect place for [shared interest]. Free Thursday?"
```

### Social Media Intelligence

**Strategic Liking Protocol:**
- Like recent posts, not deep history
- Comment meaningfully, not just emojis
- Share relevant content to your story
- Don't over-engage (appears desperate)

| Photo Type | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Main | First impression | Clear face, genuine smile |
| Activity | Show interests | Hiking, cooking, sport |
| Social | Prove you have friends | Group photo (you're clearly visible) |
| Travel | Show worldliness | Landmark or beautiful location |
| Candid | Show authenticity | Laughing, natural moment |
