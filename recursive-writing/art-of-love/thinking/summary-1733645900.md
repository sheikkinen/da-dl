# Task Continuation Summary - Phase 15 Visual Enhancement

**Generated**: 2025-06-07

## Current Status
Continuing Phase 15 visual enhancement completion for "The Art of Love" strategic framework. Chapter 4 visual integration successfully completed, proceeding with Chapter 5 to achieve 100% Phase 15 implementation.

## Progress Summary
- **Completed**: Chapters 1-4 visual integration with DeviantArt images
- **Pending**: Chapter 5 final visual integration
- **Target**: Complete Phase 15 visual enhancement framework

## Next Action
Add "Chapter Visual" section to Chapter 5 with "Triumph of the Pure" image integration following established pattern from Chapters 1-4.

## Self-Reflection
The systematic approach using phase15-implementation-complete.md as reference source has proven effective. Chapter-by-chapter completion ensures consistent formatting and thematic alignment across the strategic framework.

## Process Improvement
For future visual integration tasks, maintaining centralized image selection documentation (like phase15-implementation-complete.md) streamlines the implementation process and ensures thematic coherence.
