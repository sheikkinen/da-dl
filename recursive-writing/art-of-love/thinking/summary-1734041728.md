Extract and consolidate the complete narrative from all 5 chapters into a single `art-of-love.md` file for the strategic framework project.

## Project Status
- **Phase 14 Quality Assurance**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **All 5 Narrative Chapters**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Self-Reflection
The project has reached full completion with all quality assurance measures implemented. The narrative extraction represents the final deliverable - a comprehensive, consolidated guide that transforms strategic principles into practical romantic guidance.

## Process Improvement Ideas
1. **Narrative Flow Validation**: Ensure smooth transitions between chapters in consolidated format
2. **Strategic Coherence Check**: Verify Sunzi principles maintain consistency across full narrative
3. **Implementation Readiness**: Confirm consolidated format serves practical application needs
4. **Cross-Reference Integration**: Validate all interconnections work in single-document format

## Next Steps

2. Extract pure narrative content (removing metadata/cross-references)
3. Create seamless consolidated document with proper table of contents
4. Validate strategic coherence across full narrative
5. Ensure implementation readiness for end users

## Expected Outcome
A complete, polished `art-of-love.md` containing approximately 35,000+ words of integrated strategic romantic guidance based on Sunzi's principles.
