The Art of Love strategic framework project has successfully completed all development phases (1-14), delivering a comprehensive romantic strategy system based on Sunzi's Art of War principles. All quality assurance issues have been resolved, and the project is ready for implementation.

## Phase 14 Validation Results

### ✅ Tautology Resolution
**Issue**: Duplicate Sunzi quotes across chapters

- **Chapter 3**: Rapidity and timing quote (digital conversation theme)
- **Chapter 4**: Ground/terrain selection quote (meeting arrangement theme)
- **Chapter 5**: Water adaptation quote (relationship progression theme)

### ✅ Romanization Standardization
**Issue**: Inconsistent use of "Sun Tzu" vs "Sunzi"
**Resolution**: Systematically updated all 200+ references across all project files to use modern romanization "Sunzi"
