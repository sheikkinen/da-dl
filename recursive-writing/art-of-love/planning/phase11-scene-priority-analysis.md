## Scene Priority Analysis Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
Based on Sunzi's strategic principles and romantic campaign effectiveness:

1. **Strategic Impact** (1-10): Campaign success dependency
2. **Developmental Necessity** (1-10): Skill transfer and learning value  
3. **Narrative Potential** (1-10): Story engagement and educational value
4. **Tactical Complexity** (1-10): Implementation difficulty and sophistication
5. **Universal Application** (1-10): Cross-archetype and cross-scenario utility

## Priority Rankings

### **PRIORITY 1: HIGHEST IMPACT**

#### 1. Opening Message/Approach (Scene 1)
**Strategic Priority: CRITICAL**
- **Strategic Impact**: 10/10 - Determines campaign initiation success
- **Developmental Necessity**: 10/10 - Foundation skill for all romantic scenarios
- **Narrative Potential**: 9/10 - High tension, immediate consequences
- **Tactical Complexity**: 7/10 - Archetype identification and first impression mastery
- **Universal Application**: 10/10 - Essential across all platforms and venues

**Narrative Development Priority**: **IMMEDIATE**
**Rationale**: Without successful opening contact, no campaign can progress. Highest strategic leverage point with universal application across all romantic scenarios.

#### 2. First Date (Scene 4)  
**Strategic Priority: CRITICAL**
- **Strategic Impact**: 10/10 - Relationship progression gateway
- **Developmental Necessity**: 9/10 - Core interaction and escalation skills
- **Narrative Potential**: 10/10 - Peak dramatic tension and relationship dynamics
- **Tactical Complexity**: 9/10 - Multi-dimensional strategic execution
- **Universal Application**: 9/10 - Applicable across all relationship contexts

**Narrative Development Priority**: **IMMEDIATE**
**Rationale**: Critical conversion point where digital rapport must translate to physical chemistry. Highest narrative tension with complex strategic execution.

### **PRIORITY 2: FOUNDATION BUILDING**

#### 3. Response/Conversation Building (Scene 2)
**Strategic Priority: HIGH**
- **Strategic Impact**: 8/10 - Essential for rapport establishment 
- **Developmental Necessity**: 9/10 - Core communication and escalation skills
- **Narrative Potential**: 7/10 - Character development through dialogue
- **Tactical Complexity**: 8/10 - Sustained engagement and archetype adaptation
- **Universal Application**: 9/10 - Critical across all digital platforms

**Narrative Development Priority**: **PHASE 12**
**Rationale**: Essential foundation skill that bridges initial contact to meeting arrangement. High teaching value for sustained romantic communication.

#### 4. First Meeting Arrangement (Scene 3)
**Strategic Priority: HIGH**
- **Strategic Impact**: 8/10 - Critical transition from digital to physical
- **Developmental Necessity**: 7/10 - Logistics and planning competence
- **Narrative Potential**: 6/10 - Moderate tension, anticipation building
- **Tactical Complexity**: 6/10 - Strategic venue selection and timing
- **Universal Application**: 8/10 - Essential skill across all scenarios

**Narrative Development Priority**: **PHASE 12**
**Rationale**: Strategic bridge scene that demonstrates planning competence. Lower narrative tension but essential skill development.

### **PRIORITY 3: CONSOLIDATION**

#### 5. Post-Date Follow-Up (Scene 5)
**Strategic Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH**
- **Strategic Impact**: 7/10 - Relationship momentum and commitment building
- **Developmental Necessity**: 8/10 - Long-term relationship skills
- **Narrative Potential**: 8/10 - Emotional resolution and relationship progression
- **Tactical Complexity**: 7/10 - Strategic communication and expectation management
- **Universal Application**: 8/10 - Critical for relationship consolidation

**Narrative Development Priority**: **PHASE 13**
**Rationale**: Important for relationship progression but dependent on successful first date execution. High emotional and strategic value for campaign completion.
