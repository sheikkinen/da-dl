## Blood and Steel

Three days after the blizzard broke, Maya found herself hunting in the skeletal remains of what had once been London's industrial heart. The massive foundries and factories stood like metal cathedrals against the toxic sky, their broken windows reflecting the perpetual amber twilight that passed for daylight in the ruins.

She moved through the maze of rusted machinery with the fluid grace of a predator, her leather boots silent on the debris-strewn concrete. The weight of Erik's compass pressed against her chest—a reminder of purpose beyond mere survival. Today's hunt was different. Word had reached her through the trader networks: eastern raiders were probing westward, testing defenses, marking territory.

Maya paused beside a massive steam boiler, its copper hull green with corrosion. Through a gap in the twisted metal framework ahead, she could see movement. Three figures in mismatched armor picked through a pile of salvage, their voices carrying in the still air. Not local scavengers—these moved with military precision, and the red cloth tied around their arms marked them as advance scouts from the territories beyond the dead zones.

The Crimson Horde. Erik had warned her about them in his final weeks, spinning tales of eastern warlords who painted their conquests in blood. Maya had dismissed the stories as fever dreams, but the evidence was spreading across the wasteland like a cancer. Burned settlements. Crucified survivors. Messages written in corpses.

She studied the raiders' equipment through the scope of her modified hunting rifle. Good gear—too good for common bandits. The largest carried a weapon that might have been a pre-war assault rifle, extensively modified with scavenged parts. Military tattoos covered his exposed arms, and the way he moved suggested formal training. These weren't desperate scavengers; they were professionals.

Maya's finger found the rifle's trigger. One shot would drop the leader, but the others would scatter, carry word back to their masters. Better to handle this quietly, up close, where she could search their bodies for intelligence about whatever was coming from the east.

She slung the rifle across her back and drew the combat knife Erik had given her—eight inches of pre-war steel, its edge honed to razor sharpness. The weight felt comfortable in her grip, an extension of her will. Erik's training whispered in her mind: *Violence is a tool, Maya. Use it precisely, or it will use you.*

The first raider died without knowing she was there. Maya's blade found the gap between his helmet and body armor, severing the carotid artery in one smooth motion. He dropped silently behind a pile of scrap metal, blood pooling in the dust.

But the second raider had military instincts. He spun at the soft sound of his partner's fall, raising his weapon—a sawed-off shotgun that would turn Maya into paste at close range. She was already moving, using the industrial wreckage as cover, her dark leathers blending with the shadows between the machines.

"Contact!" he barked into a radio strapped to his chest. "Unknown hostile, grid seven-seven."

Maya cursed under her breath. So much for subtlety. She heard boots on concrete as the third raider moved to flank her position. Professional tactics, coordinated movement. These weren't random bandits—they were advance reconnaissance for something much larger.

The shotgun wielder fired twice, buckshot sparking off the steel beam she crouched behind. Maya rolled left, came up beside a broken conveyor belt, and threw her knife in one fluid motion. The blade took him in the throat, spinning him backward into a pile of rusted chains.

Which left the leader.

Maya retrieved her knife and turned to face him, wiping the blood on her leather sleeve. He stood thirty feet away, assault rifle trained on her center mass, finger steady on the trigger. Professional soldier, definitely. The tattoos on his arms marked him as a veteran of the resource wars that had preceded the Collapse. A survivor like her, but one who'd chosen a different path.

"The Wanderer," he said, voice carrying a trace of eastern European accent. "Viktor will be pleased to know you're real."

"Viktor?" Maya kept her voice level, unthreatening. Distance was her enemy now—she needed him closer.

"Viktor the Scarred. Lord of the Crimson Horde. We've been tracking your movements for weeks." The raider smiled, revealing teeth filed to points—a common modification among the more savage clans. "He's very interested in meeting you."

"I don't take meetings with cannibals."

"Cannibals?" The raider laughed, genuinely amused. "My dear Wanderer, we're not savages. We're evolutionaries. We understand what this world has become, what it demands. The strong consume the weak—that's the only truth that matters now."

Maya shifted her weight, calculating angles. The rifle's muzzle tracked her movement with professional precision. "And what does your Viktor want with me?"

"You've survived fifteen years in the wasteland. You know the old roads, the safe passages. That knowledge has value." The raider's finger tightened on the trigger. "He's prepared to make you an offer. Join the Horde, share what you know, and claim your place among the strong. Refuse..."

Maya moved before he could finish the sentence. She dove behind a steam pipe as the rifle chattered, bullets sparking off metal and concrete. But she'd seen what she needed—the slight relaxation in his stance as he spoke, the momentary shift in his attention. Professional or not, he'd made the classic mistake of treating her as prey instead of predator.

She came up from behind a machinery housing with a length of steel pipe in her hands, hurling it like a spear. The improvised weapon took him in the shoulder, spinning him around and sending the rifle clattering across the concrete. He recovered quickly—too quickly—drawing a combat knife as he turned to face her.

The real fight began.

Maya had learned her trade in the ruins of London, where survival meant adapting to whatever the wasteland threw at you. Erik had taught her to read the landscape of violence, to use every advantage—environmental, psychological, physical. The raider was stronger, heavier, with reach and military training. But Maya fought like the wasteland itself: unpredictable, adaptive, utterly without mercy.

She used the industrial wreckage as her ally, leading him through a maze of broken machinery and fallen girders. When he lunged with his knife, she rolled under a conveyor belt and came up behind him, her blade finding the gap in his armor below the ribs. He spun, backhanding her across the face with enough force to send her stumbling into a pile of scrap metal.

Blood filled her mouth—metallic, warm, familiar. She spat red onto the concrete and smiled. "That all you've got, soldier boy?"

His answer was a savage overhead strike that would have split her skull. Maya caught his wrist, used his momentum to throw him over her shoulder into a steam boiler. The impact rang like a bell, denting the copper hull. He rolled away before she could follow up, faster than she'd expected despite his armor.

The knife fight that followed was brutal in its intimacy. Close quarters, blade work, each seeking the killing angle. Maya's leathers parted under his steel, thin lines of fire across her ribs and shoulders. But her own blade found its mark repeatedly—shallow cuts that bled freely, wearing him down by degrees.

She ended it with Erik's favorite technique: a feint high that drew his guard up, followed by a low thrust that punched through his armor into the femoral artery. He dropped to his knees, pressing both hands to the wound as his life pumped out between his fingers.

"Viktor..." he gasped, looking up at her with something that might have been respect. "Viktor will come for you. He knows what you are now."

"Let him come." Maya wiped her blade clean on his jacket. "The wasteland has room for one more corpse."

She searched the bodies methodically, gathering intelligence. Radio equipment, maps marked with supply routes, ammunition that fired rounds she'd never seen. Most disturbing were the photographs—surveillance shots of her taken over the past month. Someone had been watching, learning her patterns, her habits.

The radio crackled to life: "Scout Team Seven, report status."

Maya keyed the transmitter. "Team Seven is dead. Tell your Viktor that the Wanderer is coming for him."

She smashed the radio and gathered what gear she could carry. The bodies she arranged carefully—a message for whoever found them. She used the raider's own knife to carve Erik's compass symbol into the leader's forehead, then positioned the corpses in a triangle around the symbol.

Let the Crimson Horde know they'd found her. Let them understand that London's Wanderer wouldn't go quietly into whatever darkness they brought with them.

As Maya disappeared into the industrial maze, steam hissed from broken pipes like the breathing of sleeping giants. The amber light caught the blood on the concrete, turning it to copper and shadow. Somewhere in the east, she knew, an army was stirring. Viktor the Scarred had made his move, sending scouts to test her strength.

He'd found his answer written in blood and steel.

Maya smiled beneath her mask, feeling the old hunger stirring in her chest—the part of her that Erik had tried to civilize but never quite tamed. The part that enjoyed the dance of violence, that found beauty in the moment when life yielded to death.

Let Viktor come. The wasteland had made her in its image: brutal, adaptive, unbreakable. She was the Wanderer, and she would not yield.

In the distance, storm clouds gathered over the London ruins, pregnant with radioactive rain. But Maya was already moving, already planning, already becoming the legend the wasteland demanded.

The hunt had begun.
