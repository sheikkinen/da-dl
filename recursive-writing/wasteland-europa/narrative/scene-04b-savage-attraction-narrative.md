## Savage Attraction

The trading post squatted like a festering wound against the skeletal remains of what had once been a shopping center. Maya crouched on the overpass above, her new leather mask concealing everything but her eyes as she surveyed the scene below. The smell of unwashed bodies, rotting meat, and desperation rose like heat waves from the concrete courtyard.

Three cages. Human cargo. The sight made her jaw clench beneath the mask.

She'd followed the screams here, drawn by the sound of suffering that had become the wasteland's most consistent currency. Below, traders haggled over prices while their merchandise—hollow-eyed survivors—pressed against the bars like broken dolls.

"Fresh meat from the eastern sectors," called a gap-toothed woman to potential buyers. "This one's got fight left in her." She jabbed a rusted pipe at a cage containing a young woman with defiant eyes and torn clothing. "Good for breeding stock or entertainment."

Maya's hand moved to the combat knife Erik had given her. The weight of it felt different now, heavier with purpose. Three guards, maybe four. Armed but careless. She could—

"Planning to play hero?"

The voice came from directly behind her. Maya spun, knife already in motion, but a strong hand caught her wrist with surprising gentleness. A man materialized from the shadows—tall, lean, with predatory grace and eyes like winter storms. His face was angular, scarred, but undeniably magnetic in the way dangerous things often were.

"Easy, huntress," he murmured, his accent carrying traces of old Europe. "I'm not your enemy."

Maya kept the knife steady between them, studying his face. Dark hair fell across sharp features, and when he smiled, it was all teeth and dark promise. He wore well-maintained leathers that spoke of prosperity in this desolate world, and weapons that gleamed with professional care.

"Then what are you?" she asked, her voice deliberately rough behind the mask.

"Someone who appreciates a kindred spirit." His thumb traced across her wrist where he still held it, the touch sending an unexpected jolt through her system. "You came for them." He nodded toward the cages. "So did I."

"Why?"

"Because sometimes the world needs reminding that predators can be prey." His grip loosened but didn't release her. "And because I find myself curious about the woman who walks alone in a mask."

There was something magnetic about his presence, a pull Maya felt in her chest and lower. He radiated controlled violence and sexual confidence in equal measure—exactly the kind of man Erik had warned her about. The kind who made smart women make stupid choices.

"I work alone," she said, but made no move to pull away.

"So do I. Usually." His free hand rose to almost—but not quite—touch her mask. "But there's something about you, masked lady. Something that makes me want to break my own rules."

Below them, one of the captives cried out as a guard kicked the cage. The sound snapped Maya back to purpose, though the stranger's proximity continued to scramble her thoughts.

"We can continue this philosophical discussion after we handle the slavers," she said.

"Practical and mysterious. I like that." He finally released her wrist, the absence of his touch leaving her skin tingling. "What's your plan?"

Maya studied him for a long moment. Every instinct Erik had drilled into her screamed warnings, but something else—something newer and more primal—whispered possibilities. "You take the two on the left. I'll handle the right side and the cages."

"Together then." He checked his weapons with practiced efficiency—a sword across his back, knives at his belt, a pistol holstered at his hip. All of it expensive, all of it deadly. "Try to keep up."

"Try not to get in my way."

He laughed, the sound low and genuinely amused. "I do enjoy a woman with spirit."

They moved down opposite sides of the overpass, shadows against rusted metal. Maya's pulse hammered not just from adrenaline now, but from the awareness of being watched by someone who appreciated her deadliness. It was intoxicating and terrifying in equal measure.

The attack came swift and brutal. Maya dropped onto the first guard from above, her knife finding the space between his ribs before he could scream. Across the courtyard, the stranger moved like liquid violence, his blade taking the second guard's throat in one smooth motion.

But Maya had miscounted. A third guard emerged from behind the cages, shotgun rising toward her exposed back.

The stranger's throwing knife took him in the shoulder, spinning him around. Maya rolled, came up with her sidearm, and put two rounds center mass. The man dropped, but not before his finger found the trigger.

The buckshot meant for Maya instead shredded the stranger's left shoulder, spinning him into the cage bars. He hit hard, blood immediately soaking his leathers, but when Maya reached him, he was laughing.

"Sloppy," he gasped, pressing a hand to the wound. "Haven't made a mistake like that in years."

"You're bleeding," Maya said, surprised by the concern in her own voice.

"Occupational hazard." He tried to stand, stumbled, and Maya caught him. The contact sent heat racing through both of them. "Seems I'm in your debt, huntress."

"The captives—"

"Already handled." He nodded toward the cages, where the freed survivors were helping each other stand. "Keys were on the fat one."

Maya supported more of his weight than she'd intended, acutely aware of the solid warmth of him against her side. "You need medical attention."

"I know a place." His eyes met hers, intense despite the pain. "Safe house, about a mile north. Medical supplies, real beds, decent food." A pause. "Privacy."

The word hung between them, heavy with implication. Maya knew she should refuse, should disappear into the wasteland as she always did. But something about this man—this dangerous, magnetic stranger who'd risked himself for people he didn't know—made her want to break her own rules.

"What's your name?" she asked.

"Marcus." The name came easily, though something in his eyes suggested it might not be his real one. "And you, mysterious lady?"

"Maya." The truth slipped out before she could stop it.

"Maya." He repeated it like he was tasting wine. "A name as beautiful as its owner, I'd imagine."

"You don't know what I look like."

"I know enough." His hand found her face, fingers tracing the edge of her mask. "I know you move like a dancer and kill like an artist. I know you risked yourself for strangers. I know when you look at me, something in your body responds whether your mind approves or not."

The last observation made her breath catch. "You're injured. You're not thinking clearly."

"Blood loss makes some things clearer, not cloudier." His thumb found the corner of her mouth through the mask's opening. "Come with me, Maya. Let me show you that not all dangerous men are enemies."

She should say no. Should disappear into the ruins and never see him again. But as she looked into his storm-grey eyes, feeling the heat of his body against hers and the magnetic pull of his presence, Maya found herself nodding.

"Just until you're stable enough to travel," she said.

His smile was predatory and promising. "Of course. Just until then."

As they walked toward his promised safe house, Maya's freed captives melting into the London ruins behind them, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was walking into something far more dangerous than any slaver's den. The stranger—Marcus—radiated control and sexuality in ways that made her body respond despite her mind's warnings.

But for the first time since Erik's death, she didn't feel alone in the wasteland. And as his hand found hers in the gathering dusk, Maya allowed herself to wonder what it might mean to want something more than just survival.

The safe house, when they reached it, was exactly as promised—secure, well-supplied, and absolutely private. As Marcus led her inside, his eyes never leaving hers, Maya realized she was about to discover just how dangerous attraction could be in a world where trust was a luxury few could afford.

The door closed behind them with a soft click, and Maya's heart rate spiked as she realized there was no going back. Not from this moment, not from this choice, and certainly not from the magnetic pull of the man who watched her with eyes full of dark promise.

"Now then," Marcus said, his voice low and intimate as he turned to face her fully. "Let me show you proper hospitality, Maya. You've earned it."

The night was young, and Maya was about to learn that some hungers were more dangerous than any physical threat the wasteland could offer.
