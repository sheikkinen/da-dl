The fire crackled between us, casting our faces in amber light against the endless dark of the London wasteland. Three days since we'd taken refuge in this abandoned industrial complex, three days since Marcus and I had pulled together this ragtag group of survivors. Tonight felt different—peaceful in a way that made my skin crawl with unease.

"Tell us about before," whispered Sarah, the young woman we'd rescued from the collapsed tube station. Her eyes held that desperate hunger for stories of the world that existed before the Great Collapse.

Marcus passed around the last of our scavenged protein bars. "Maya knows more about the old world than any of us," he said, his scarred face serious in the firelight. "She's seen the deep archives."

I adjusted the leather mask that covered the upper half of my face, feeling the familiar weight of Erik's legacy. "The old world died for good reasons," I said quietly. "We're building something better from its bones."

A sound in the darkness—subtle, wrong. Metal scraping against concrete where no metal should move.

I held up a closed fist, and conversation died instantly. Around the fire, six faces turned to me with the trust that still felt foreign, still felt like a weight I wasn't sure I could carry. But Erik's voice echoed in my memory: *Leadership isn't about being ready, Maya. It's about acting when others can't.*

Another sound. Footsteps on gravel, trying to be silent and failing.

I pointed to positions around our makeshift camp—behind the rusted machinery, the concrete barriers, the overturned transport containers. My people moved like shadows, weapons appearing in their hands with practiced silence. Marcus checked his crossbow. Sarah gripped the combat knife I'd given her, her knuckles white but her stance solid.

The first raider came through the gap in the eastern wall like death given form—leather and metal, scarred flesh and crude weapons, the red bandana of the Crimson Horde around his neck. He thought he was hunting prey.

He died learning he'd found predators instead.

My throwing knife took him in the throat before he could cry out, the blade sliding between leather armor plates with the precision Erik had drilled into me through ten thousand repetitions. He dropped without a sound, blood pooling dark around the firelight.

But where there was one scout, there were always more.

They came from three directions at once—professional, coordinated, deadly. The Horde didn't send amateurs into the deep wastes. These were killers who'd survived the toxic storms and radioactive zones, who'd earned their red bandanas through violence and cunning.

Marcus's crossbow sent a bolt through the eye of the raider coming from the north, the impact snapping the man's head back with a wet crack. Sarah rolled behind cover as gunfire erupted, her knife flashing as she hamstrung a raider who'd gotten too close to her position.

But it was the one coming straight at me that I wanted.

He was huge—nearly seven feet of muscle and scar tissue, wielding a makeshift war hammer built from rebar and concrete chunks. His face was a map of old violence, one eye gone, teeth filed to points in the Horde tradition. He'd painted himself with the ritual scars that marked him as a clan champion.

"You're the Wanderer," he growled, his voice like grinding stone. "Viktor wants your head."

"Viktor can come collect it himself," I replied, drawing the long combat knife from my thigh sheath.

He swung the hammer with enough force to pulp a skull, but I wasn't there anymore. I'd learned to move like smoke from Erik, like death from necessity. The hammer sparked against concrete as I slid under his guard, my blade finding the gap between his armor plates just below the ribs.

He roared, pain and fury mixing as he spun to catch me with a backhand that would have shattered bones. But I was already moving, dancing around him like a shadow made solid. Another cut, this one across the tendons of his sword arm. The hammer fell from nerveless fingers.

"You fight like a coward," he snarled, trying to grapple me with his good arm.

"I fight like someone who means to survive," I corrected, and opened his throat with a single economical slash.

The big raider fell to his knees, then forward onto his face, blood spreading in a dark pool that reflected our guttering fire. Around me, the sounds of combat were fading—my people had proven themselves once again.

"Maya!" Marcus called out. "Got one alive!"

The surviving raider was pinned beneath an overturned metal beam, his leg clearly broken, blood seeping from a head wound. But his eyes still held defiance, still held the fanatic's light that made the Horde so dangerous.

I knelt beside him, letting him see the blood on my blade, the bodies of his companions. "How many more are coming?"

He spat at me, the saliva mixed with blood. "Enough to paint the wasteland with your guts, bitch."

"Wrong answer." I pressed the knife point against his throat, just hard enough to break skin. "How many?"

"Go fuck yourself with a—"

The scream that followed was brief but educational. When it faded, he was more cooperative.

"Fifty," he gasped out. "Viktor's sending fifty fighters. They're... they're three days behind us."

Fifty. A full war party. More than we could handle, even with our newfound skills and teamwork.

"Why?" I asked. "Why does Viktor want me so badly?"

The raider's laugh was wet with blood. "Because you're becoming something he can't control. The stories are spreading—the Masked Wanderer who walks between the dead zones, who builds armies from the lost and forgotten. He needs to kill you before you become a legend."

Too late for that, I thought but didn't say. The legend was already growing, fed by actions like this night's work.

I looked up at Marcus, saw him nod once. We both understood what had to happen next.

"Any last words?" I asked the raider.

"See you in hell," he whispered.

"Give my regards to the others when you get there."

The knife slid home with professional precision. No suffering, just a clean end. Even Horde scum deserved that much.

Afterward, we dragged the bodies outside our perimeter and arranged them in the ritual pattern Erik had taught me—a message written in corpses for any other scouts who might be watching. We are not prey. We are not victims. We are the ones who survived when the world ended, and we will not go quietly into the dark.

Around the rekindled fire, my people cleaned their weapons and tended their wounds. Sarah had taken a graze across her shoulder but had killed her first raider with the knife work I'd taught her. The pride in her eyes was worth more than all the pre-Collapse treasures in the dead museums.

"Fifty fighters," Marcus said quietly, settling beside me. "That's too many for a direct fight."

"Then we don't fight them directly," I replied. "We're not raiders. We're survivors. We think, we adapt, we overcome."

"The tunnel?" he asked.

I nodded. The Channel Tunnel was our only route to the continent, our only path to the mysterious archives that might hold the key to humanity's future. And if Viktor wanted to follow us into that radioactive hell, let him try.

"We leave at first light," I decided. "Let the dead tell their story. Let Viktor know that the Wanderer doesn't run from fights—she chooses her battles."

The fire burned lower as my people settled into watch rotation. Sarah took first guard, her movements confident now in a way they hadn't been three days ago. Marcus checked our gear and supplies with the methodical thoroughness of a born quartermaster.

And I sat in the darkness beyond the firelight, cleaning my knives and thinking about the violence to come. Fifty fighters was just the beginning. As we moved deeper into the wasteland, as the legend grew, the challenges would only get deadlier.

But tonight we had proven something important. We weren't just a group of survivors thrown together by chance. We were becoming something more—a family forged in blood and choice, united by shared purpose and mutual protection.

The Crimson Horde wanted to paint the wasteland with our blood. They were welcome to try.

But they'd find that the Wanderer and her people painted back.
