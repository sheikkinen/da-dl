## The Herald's Warning

A week had passed since Maya discovered the Cartographer's Testament, and she had spent every waking hour studying its cryptic markings. Her shelter—a reinforced basement beneath the ruins of a Camden pub—had become a war room. The ancient map lay spread across a salvaged table, weighted down by pieces of concrete rubble. Around it, she had arranged her own crude charts of the London wasteland, marking supply caches, danger zones, and possible routes to the south.

The map's golden star seemed to pulse in the candlelight, calling to her from the Swiss Alps. *The Last Sanctuary.* If it truly existed, it represented hope not just for her, but for any survivor willing to make the journey. But the route looked treacherous—through the flooded Channel Tunnel, across the irradiated French countryside, and into territories controlled by raider clans that made London's scavengers look civilized.

Maya traced the red-ink route with her finger, memorizing every notation. "Underground Allies - Dr. E. Vasquez, Archive Section 7." Paris. The City of Light had survived better than most, according to refugee reports. Something about the underground systems, the natural barriers of the Seine, and an organized resistance that had held the city center against the worst of the Collapse.

The wind outside picked up, carrying with it the familiar scents of rust, decay, and something else—something that made Maya's skin crawl. Smoke. Not the clean smoke of a cooking fire, but the thick, oily smoke of burning settlements. And underneath it, something worse: the copper smell of fresh blood carried on the wind.

She was reaching for her binoculars when she heard it—footsteps stumbling through the rubble outside her shelter. Uneven, desperate, the sound of someone running on their last reserves of strength. Maya's hand moved to her pistol as she crept to the reinforced window that gave her a view of the approaches.

A figure staggered into view, silhouetted against the gray evening sky. Human, definitely human, but barely. The person—she couldn't tell if it was a man or woman—moved with the lurching gait of someone pushed beyond physical limits. Clothes hung in tatters, and even from a distance, Maya could see the dark stains that could only be blood.

The figure collapsed twenty meters from her shelter, falling to hands and knees on the broken asphalt. Maya watched for a full minute, counting heartbeats, checking for signs of pursuit or ambush. When nothing else moved in the wasteland, she made her decision.

"Shit," she muttered, grabbing her medical kit and rifle. "Erik always said compassion would get me killed."

But Erik had also taught her that information was more valuable than ammunition, and this person had clearly come from somewhere. Somewhere bad, judging by their condition.

Maya emerged from her shelter with practiced caution, rifle ready but not obviously threatening. As she drew closer, she could see that the figure was a young man, perhaps twenty-five, with radiation burns along his arms and a makeshift bandage around his head that was soaked through with blood.

"Hey," she called softly, stopping three meters away. "You alive over there?"

The man's head jerked up, revealing eyes wide with terror and exhaustion. "Please," he gasped, his voice raw from screaming. "Please, you have to listen. He's coming. The Walking Apocalypse is coming from the east."

Maya felt ice form in her stomach. She'd heard the name whispered in trading posts, mentioned in frightened rumors among refugee groups. Viktor "The Scarred" Kozlov—the raider lord who commanded the Crimson Horde. But "Walking Apocalypse" was new. That suggested something had changed.

"Who's coming?" she asked, kneeling beside the messenger but keeping her rifle ready. "What happened to you?"

"Canary Wharf," the man whispered, referring to the settlement built in the ruins of London's financial district. "He took Canary Wharf yesterday. Didn't just raid it—*consumed* it. Every building burned, every person dead or taken." His eyes focused on Maya with desperate intensity. "But it wasn't like before. They worship him now. The raiders, they call him the Herald of the Apocalypse. They think he's going to finish what the Collapse started."

Maya's blood ran cold. She'd known Viktor by reputation—a brutal but pragmatic raider lord who controlled territory from the Rhine Valley to the edges of what had once been Poland. Violent, yes, but rational. A businessman in blood and terror. But if his own followers were starting to see him as something supernatural...

"How many?" she asked.

"Hundreds. Maybe thousands." The messenger coughed, specking his lips with blood. "They're not just raiding anymore. They're on some kind of... crusade. Moving west, taking everything. And he's looking for something. Maps, old maps. Paying good scrap for anything that shows routes or safe passages."

Maya's hand unconsciously moved to her jacket, where the Cartographer's Testament rested against her heart. "Maps to where?"

"Don't know. But they tortured the elder for hours before they killed him. Asking about 'the Testament,' about 'the path to sanctuary.'" The messenger's breathing was becoming more labored. "I was on watch when they hit us. Saw the whole thing from the water tower. Took me two days to get here."

*Two days.* Which meant Viktor's horde was perhaps three days behind, maybe four if they were consolidating their gains in Canary Wharf. Not much time to prepare, but enough to run if she moved fast.

"What's your name?" Maya asked gently.

"Tommy. Tommy Chen. I was a scavenger with the Wharf crew." His eyes were beginning to lose focus. "Listen, there's something else. Something important."

Maya leaned closer.

"He's got prisoners. Lots of them. But not for slaves or sport." Tommy's voice dropped to a whisper. "He's building something. Some kind of... ritual. The survivors, they said he's trying to open a door. To finish the Collapse properly this time."

Before Maya could ask what that meant, Tommy's eyes rolled back and he collapsed fully onto the broken pavement. She checked his pulse—weak but steady. He was alive, but barely. Blood loss, radiation exposure, and exhaustion had pushed him to his absolute limit.

Maya dragged him into her shelter and did what she could with her medical supplies, but she knew it was probably too late. The best she could manage was to make him comfortable. As she worked, her mind raced through the implications of what he'd told her.

Viktor was coming west. He was looking for maps, specifically "the Testament"—which could only mean her map. And if the rumors about some kind of apocalyptic ritual were true, then the Cartographer's Testament might be more than just a route to safety. It might be the key to something far more dangerous.

She looked at the map spread on her table, seeing it now with new eyes. What if the sanctuary wasn't just a place of safety? What if it was something Viktor needed for his "ritual"? What if by seeking sanctuary, she would be leading him directly to whatever he was trying to achieve?

But the alternative was staying in London and dying when the Crimson Horde arrived. And if Tommy was right about Viktor's timeline, she had maybe three days to get out of the city before the net closed around her.

Maya began packing with methodical efficiency. Food, water, ammunition, medical supplies—everything she could carry without slowing herself down. The map went into its waterproof pouch, and she sealed that inside a second container. If Viktor wanted it so badly, she'd make damn sure he couldn't have it.

As she worked, Tommy stirred on the makeshift bed she'd arranged for him.

"The birds," he mumbled, his voice barely audible. "The birds won't fly east anymore. Even they know he's coming."

Maya paused in her packing. She'd noticed that herself over the past week—the way the ravens and crows seemed to avoid the eastern approaches to the city. Animals were more sensitive to radiation than humans, but this seemed different. More like... fear.

"Tommy," she said quietly. "Is there anything else? Anything about Viktor himself? About what he's become?"

Tommy's eyes opened, focusing on her with an effort that cost him. "He doesn't look human anymore. Burns cover half his face, but they're not from radiation. They're from fire, from inside. And his voice..." Tommy shuddered. "When he speaks, it's like hearing the world die all over again."

With that, Tommy Chen closed his eyes and didn't open them again. Maya checked his pulse one more time—nothing. The last messenger from Canary Wharf was dead, his warning delivered.

Maya stood in her shelter, surrounded by the accumulated survival gear of three years, and made the decision that would define the rest of her life. She couldn't outrun Viktor forever, and she couldn't hide from him if he was systematically conquering the wasteland. But she could reach the sanctuary first. She could discover what made it so important, and maybe—just maybe—she could find a way to stop whatever Viktor was planning.

The Cartographer's Testament had shown her a path to hope. Now it was also a path to war.

She shouldered her pack, picked up her rifle, and took one last look around the shelter that had been home for two years. Tomorrow, she would begin the most dangerous journey of her life. Tonight, she would honor Tommy Chen's sacrifice by preparing to leave London forever.

Outside, the wind carried the smell of smoke and distant screams. The Walking Apocalypse was coming from the east, but Maya Thorne was heading south. 

The race for the Last Sanctuary had begun.
