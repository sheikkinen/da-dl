## The Museum Discovery

The morning light filtered through the shattered remains of the British Museum's great glass dome, casting fractured rainbows across the rubble-strewn floor. Maya Thorne crouched behind a fallen marble column, her radiation detector clicking softly in the palm of her gloved hand. The reading was elevated but manageable—she'd survived worse in the London ruins.

*Old Erik would have called this place a tomb,* she thought, adjusting the filtration mask over her nose and mouth. *But tombs sometimes hold treasures worth dying for.*

The museum's Reading Room stretched before her like a cathedral of knowledge turned crypt. Skeletal remains dotted the space where desperate survivors had once sought shelter, their bones now bleached white by decades of filtered sunlight. Books and scrolls lay scattered like autumn leaves, their pages crumbling to dust at the slightest disturbance.

Maya's boots made no sound as she moved between the debris, her dark leather jacket and tactical pants blending with the shadows. She'd learned to move like smoke through ruins—a skill that had kept her alive for thirty-four years in this wasteland that had once been civilization.

The Geographica section lay in the eastern wing, according to the museum map she'd memorized from a guidebook found months ago. If the pre-war records were accurate, it would contain the largest collection of historical maps in Europe. Maps that might show routes, safe passages, or—if she was extraordinarily lucky—places that had survived the Great Collapse.

A soft skittering sound made her freeze. Maya's hand moved instinctively to the combat knife at her thigh, fingers wrapping around the worn grip. The sound came again—claws on marble, too large to be rats, too careful to be random debris settling.

*Scavengers.* Not the human kind—those she could reason with or intimidate. These were the other kind. The kind that radiation and desperation had twisted into something that still remembered being human but no longer cared.

She counted three distinct movement patterns in the shadows ahead. Maya closed her eyes and listened to Old Erik's voice in her memory: *"When you're outnumbered, darling, you don't fight fair. You fight to survive."*

Maya pulled a small mirror from her pack and angled it to catch the light, sending a brief flash toward the far wall. The skittering stopped. One. Two. Three—

They came from different directions, just as she'd expected. The first one dropped from the upper gallery, a humanoid shape with elongated limbs and yellowed teeth filed to points. Maya rolled left as it landed where she'd been standing, her knife finding its throat in one smooth motion.

The second scavenger rushed from between the toppled bookshelves, makeshift weapons in both hands. Maya grabbed a chunk of marble debris and hurled it at the creature's head, following up with a precise kick that sent it sprawling into a display case full of ancient pottery.

The third one was smarter—or hungrier. It had circled around behind her while she dealt with the others. Maya felt its presence rather than heard it, spinning just as clawed fingers raked the air where her head had been. This one was larger, more muscled, with crude scars covering radiation-mottled skin.

"Come on then," Maya whispered, settling into a combat stance Erik had drilled into her a thousand times. "Let's dance."

The fight was brutal and brief. Maya used the environment to her advantage, leading the creature through a maze of fallen columns and scattered artifacts. When it finally cornered her near the map collection, she was exactly where she wanted to be.

The scavenger lunged. Maya dropped and rolled, grabbing a heavy brass astrolabe from the floor. As the creature stumbled past her, she brought the ancient instrument up with both hands, the sharp edges finding the soft spot at the base of its skull.

Silence fell over the Reading Room like a shroud. Maya stood among the bodies, breathing hard but uninjured. She wiped her knife clean on a scrap of cloth and began searching the map collection with methodical precision.

Most of the maps had deteriorated beyond usefulness—moisture, radiation, and time had claimed them. But in a climate-controlled case near the back of the collection, she found something that made her heart race.

The case was intact, its environmental seals still holding after nearly seven decades. Inside, laid out on preservation fabric, was a hand-drawn map unlike anything she'd ever seen. The paper was thick and yellow with age, but the ink remained dark and clear. Across the top, written in elegant script, were the words: "The Cartographer's Testament - Final Route to Sanctuary, 2087."

Maya's hands trembled as she carefully opened the case. The map showed Europe as it had existed before the Collapse, but overlaid with notations in several different hands. Routes were marked in red ink, with dates and notes in the margins. Safe passages through what would become the wasteland. Underground waterways that might still be navigable. And there, in the Swiss Alps, marked with a golden star and labeled "The Last Sanctuary"—a place that might still exist.

"My God," she whispered, her voice echoing in the vast space. "Erik, you magnificent bastard. You were right."

Old Erik had always insisted that somewhere in Europe, the wise and wealthy had prepared. Underground cities, mountain strongholds, places where civilization might have survived the chaos. Most survivors dismissed such talk as fantasy, but Erik had been a cartographer before the Collapse. He understood maps, understood how people thought about geography and escape routes.

And here was proof.

Maya studied the map carefully, tracing the marked route with her finger. London to the Channel Tunnel—or what remained of it. Through the wasteland of northern France to Paris, where notes indicated "Underground Allies - Dr. E. Vasquez, Archive Section 7." From Paris through the German ruins to the Rhine Valley, then south to the Alps where the golden star waited.

The route was dangerous—it passed through territories controlled by raider clans, irradiated zones, and the collapsed urban centers where the worst of humanity had taken refuge. But it was possible. Difficult, but possible.

Maya felt something she hadn't experienced in years: hope. Not the grim hope of finding enough food for another week, but real hope. The possibility of something better than mere survival.

She carefully folded the map and slipped it into the waterproof pouch inside her jacket, next to her heart. The weight of it felt heavier than paper should—the weight of possibility, of choice, of a future that might exist beyond the daily struggle to live.

As she prepared to leave the museum, Maya touched the small pendant that hung around her neck—Erik's compass, the only thing of his she'd kept after his death three years ago. The needle pointed north, but her path would lead her south and east, into the unknown.

"I'll find it, Erik," she said quietly to the empty room. "If it exists, I'll find it. And if it doesn't... well, at least I'll die trying to build something better than this."

She gathered her pack, checked her weapons, and moved toward the museum's main entrance. Behind her, the bodies of the scavengers lay still among the ruins of human knowledge. Ahead, through the broken doors, the wasteland of London stretched under an overcast sky.

Maya Thorne, the Wanderer, stepped into the ruins of Russell Square and began planning the most dangerous journey of her life. The Cartographer's Testament burned against her chest like a promise, and for the first time since Erik's death, she smiled.

The sanctuary awaited. Now she just had to survive long enough to reach it.
