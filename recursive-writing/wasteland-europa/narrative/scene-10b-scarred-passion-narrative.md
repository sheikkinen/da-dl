## Full Narrative

The armored command vehicle rocked gently as Viktor's army made camp for the night. Outside, ten thousand warriors settled into disciplined rows of tents and war machines, but inside the steel-plated sanctuary, only two people existed in the world.

Viktor Kozlov stood shirtless before the tactical display, his scarred torso illuminated by the blue glow of digital maps. Each mark on his flesh told a story—bullet wounds, blade cuts, burns from the early days when he'd fought for every scrap of territory. The largest scar, a twisted rope of tissue running from his left shoulder to his sternum, was Katja's work.

Their first meeting had been a dance of knives in the Moscow ruins. She'd nearly killed him. He'd fallen in love with her precision.

"The Wanderer crossed the Rhine two hours ago," Katja reported from the shadows behind him, her voice carrying the formal tone she used when others might overhear. "My scouts confirmed her position. She's moving faster than expected."

Viktor's lips curved in something that might have been a smile. "She knows we're close. Good. Prey that runs straight is boring."

"Is that all she is to you? Prey?"

The question carried layers of meaning that only Katja would dare voice. Viktor turned to face her properly, studying the woman who'd been his lieutenant, his lover, his equal in violence for the past five years. Even now, after countless shared battles and intimate nights, she could still surprise him.

Katja had shed her field armor and wore only black leather pants and a sleeveless top that showed off the intricate scarification covering her arms. Viktor had given her some of those marks himself, sealing their bond in blood and ecstasy during their early months together. Others she'd earned in battles where she'd killed for him, bled for him, proven her absolute loyalty.

"Jealousy doesn't suit you, Bloodraven," Viktor said softly.

"I'm not jealous of prey," Katja replied, but there was steel in her voice. "I'm curious about obsession."

Viktor moved closer, drawn by the dangerous edge in her tone. Katja never backed down from confrontation—it was one of the things that had kept his interest for so long. Lesser women had bored him within weeks, but Katja remained a challenge, a puzzle he could never quite solve.

"You think I'm obsessed with the Wanderer?"

"I think you've been distracted since the first reports reached us. I think you study her tactics when you should be planning our advance. I think—" Katja's words cut off as Viktor's hand found her throat, fingers resting against the ritual scars he'd carved there years ago.

"You think too much," he murmured, applying just enough pressure to make breathing interesting. "That's always been your weakness."

Katja's eyes flashed dangerously, but she didn't pull away. Instead, she stepped closer, pressing against his hand. "And your weakness is thinking with your cock instead of your brain when something catches your interest."

Viktor's laugh was genuine, delighted by her audacity. "Is that what you think this is about?"

"Isn't it?" Katja's hand traced the largest scar on his chest, her touch gentle despite the challenge in her voice. "When did you last look at me the way you study reports of her movements?"

The question hit closer to home than Viktor cared to admit. He'd been thinking about the Wanderer—not just as an opponent, but as something else. Someone who might understand the necessities of leadership in this broken world. Someone who carried herself with the kind of controlled violence that reminded him of—

"You," he said suddenly, the admission surprising them both.

Katja blinked, her aggressive posture softening slightly. "What?"

"She reminds me of you. When we first met." Viktor's thumb traced along her jawline, feeling the subtle tension there. "That same controlled fury. That refusal to bend."

"And that excites you."

"Everything about strength excites me. You know that." Viktor's other hand found her hip, pulling her fully against him. "But strength without submission is just another kind of weakness."

Katja's response was to bite his thumb, hard enough to draw blood. Viktor's sharp intake of breath had nothing to do with pain.

"Careful, my lord," she said with mock sweetness. "Your 'weakness' is showing."

The challenge hung between them like electricity. Viktor could feel Katja's pulse racing under his palm, could see the way her pupils dilated despite her defiant words. Five years together had taught them both exactly how to push, how to provoke, how to dance on the edge of violence until it transformed into something else entirely.

"Strip," Viktor commanded, his voice carrying the absolute authority that ruled ten thousand warriors.

"Make me," Katja replied with a predator's smile.

The fight that followed was brief, brutal, and choreographed by years of practice. Katja was fast, skilled, deadly—but Viktor was stronger, more experienced, and had the advantage of knowing exactly how she moved in combat. When it ended with her pressed face-first against the command table, her leather top torn away and his hand twisted in her pale hair, they were both breathing hard.

"Better," Viktor murmured against her ear, his body covering hers completely. "But you're getting predictable."

"Am I?" Katja's voice was steady despite her position. "Then you won't see this coming."

Her elbow caught him in the ribs with surgical precision, driving him back just enough for her to spin and hook her leg behind his knee. Viktor went down, but took her with him, and they hit the steel floor in a tangle of limbs and violent laughter.

This was what he'd missed with other women—this perfect balance of conflict and desire, the way Katja could match his violence and transform it into passion. She understood that power was never given, only taken, and that the taking was half the pleasure.

"Tell me about her," Katja said later, her head pillowed on Viktor's scarred chest while his fingers traced lazy patterns on her skin. "The Wanderer. What do you really see when you look at the reports?"

Viktor was quiet for a long moment, considering. Outside, the army settled into the rhythms of night watch, but inside their steel sanctuary, honesty was possible.

"Someone like us," he said finally. "Someone who understands that survival requires difficult choices. That strength is the only currency that matters."

"And you want to recruit her."

"I want to understand her. There's a difference." Viktor's hand stilled on Katja's shoulder. "She could have stayed hidden in London, lived quietly as a scavenger. Instead, she's crossing a continent based on an old map and a dying man's warning. That kind of conviction is rare."

"Dangerous, you mean."

"The same thing, in our world." Viktor shifted, bringing Katja's face up to meet his gaze. "She represents something, Bloodraven. Hope, maybe. Or the possibility that civilization doesn't have to stay dead."

Katja studied his expression with the intensity she usually reserved for tracking prey. "And if she refuses to join us? If she stands against everything we've built?"

Viktor's smile was sharp as broken glass. "Then we'll discover whether her conviction is stronger than her survival instinct."

"You'd kill her yourself?"

"If necessary." The words came easily, but Viktor felt the weight of them. "But I hope it won't be necessary. I hope she's smart enough to recognize strength when she sees it."

Katja was quiet for a long time, her fingers tracing the old battle scars that mapped Viktor's history. Finally, she spoke again, her voice thoughtful.

"She won't submit. Not easily."

"I know."

"It might require breaking her first."

"I know that too." Viktor's hand found Katja's throat again, resting against the scars that marked her as his. "But some things are worth the effort."

Katja's laugh was dark with understanding. "And if she proves stronger than expected? If she breaks you instead?"

Viktor's grip tightened just enough to make her pulse jump. "Then you'll kill her for me. Won't you, my Bloodraven?"

"Without hesitation," Katja promised, and Viktor knew she meant it. That absolute loyalty, earned through blood and sealed with scars, was what bound them together more than any physical desire.

As they settled into sleep, wrapped in each other's arms atop maps that showed the convergence of two armies, Viktor allowed himself to dream of possibilities. The Wanderer represented a choice—join his vision of order through strength, or become another casualty of a world that had no place for individual heroism.

Either way, their meeting would be... memorable.

Beside him, Katja dreamed too, but her dreams were simpler, more honest. In them, she danced with a masked woman across broken ground while Viktor watched, and the dance always ended the same way—with blood on her blades and a rival's heart in her hands.

When morning came, they would resume their roles as lord and lieutenant, commander and weapon. But in the darkness before dawn, they were simply two predators who had found their perfect match in violence and desire.

The Wanderer was coming. And Viktor found himself genuinely curious to discover which of them would prove stronger when all the masks finally came off.
