## Katja's Hunt

The blood trail led north through the poisoned fields of what had once been France's breadbasket. Katja Kozlov crouched beside the dark stains on cracked earth, her fingers tracing the edges of dried crimson with lover's intimacy. Three days old, maybe four. The Wanderer's group was wounded, moving slow.

Perfect.

"Bloodraven." One of her scouts approached with the deference due a predator. "The trail splits ahead. They're trying to throw us off."

Katja rose to her full height—six feet of lean muscle and calculated violence wrapped in black leather and steel. Her pale hair was braided tight against her skull, the better to show off the ritual scars that traced her throat like a necklace of pain. Viktor had given her those marks himself, sealing their bond in blood and ecstasy.

"Show me," she commanded, her accent carrying the harsh edges of the Russian wastes where she'd been born.

The countryside ahead was a maze of abandoned farmhouses and collapsed bridges, perfect territory for prey to lose themselves. But Katja had been hunting since before the Collapse took civilization. She read the land like others read books—every broken branch, every disturbed stone told its story to eyes that knew how to see.

Three sets of tracks. Two men, one woman. The woman was injured, favoring her left leg. One of the men was large, heavy—probably the muscle. The other moved light, cautious. Leadership material.

"They think they're clever," Katja murmured, kneeling beside a scuff mark in the mud. "Splitting up, doubling back. But they're thinking like civilized people, not predators."

She pressed her palm to the earth where Maya had knelt to rest. Something electric passed through her—recognition, perhaps. Or anticipation. The masked woman who'd been causing Viktor such delicious frustration was finally within reach.

Katja's lips curved in what might charitably be called a smile.

Behind her, eight of Viktor's best riders waited for orders. Hand-picked killers who'd earned their place through brutality and absolute loyalty. They watched her with the mixture of desire and terror that Katja inspired in most men. She was Viktor's woman, untouchable, but that only made the want sharper.

"Dmitri, take four and follow the obvious trail," she ordered. "Make noise. Let them think we're fools following breadcrumbs."

The scarred Russian nodded, understanding immediately. Katja's hunts were legendary among the Horde—elaborate games of psychological warfare that broke prey before steel ever touched flesh.

"What about us, Bloodraven?" asked Pavel, her second. Young, eager, and just smart enough to be useful.

"We're going to teach our quarry about the food chain." Katja swung onto her modified war bike, the engine purring like a great cat. "They think they're the hunters now, having evaded us this long. Time to remind them they're prey."

The hunt began in earnest.

Katja led her smaller group in a wide circle, using game trails and hidden paths that predated human civilization. She'd studied this territory for weeks, preparing for exactly this moment. While Dmitri's group crashed through the obvious routes, making enough noise to wake the dead, Katja moved silent as death itself.

Two hours before sunset, she found what she was looking for.

The abandoned chapel sat on a hill overlooking the valley, its stained glass windows long since shattered by storms and scavengers. Perfect defensive position, good sight lines, single approach. Exactly where intelligent prey would go to ground.

Through her scope, Katja could see movement in the shadows within. Three figures, just as expected. They'd barricaded the doors, set up fields of fire. Prepared for a siege.

They had no idea what was coming for them.

"Pavel," Katja whispered into her comm. "Position your men at the tree line. When I give the signal, light them up. But don't kill them. I want them alive and thinking."

"Understood, Bloodraven."

Katja settled in to wait, her body coiled like a spring. This was her favorite part—the moment before violence when anything was possible. She could taste their fear already, imagine the moment when the Wanderer realized the trap was closing.

The attack came at full dark.

Pavel's team opened up with automatic weapons, muzzle flashes strobing like lightning. Glass exploded from the chapel windows as bullets chewed through stone and wood. But Katja wasn't with them—while her prey focused on the obvious threat, she was already inside their perimeter.

The chapel's back wall had crumbled decades ago. Katja slipped through the gap like smoke, night vision goggles turning darkness into grey clarity. She could hear voices inside—urgent, professional. Military training.

Interesting.

The Wanderer was exactly what Katja had expected and nothing like she'd imagined. Tall, lean, moving with predatory grace that matched Katja's own. The leather mask concealed her features, but something in her posture spoke of contained violence and hard-won competence.

Beautiful, in the way apex predators were beautiful.

The two men with her were covering the main approaches while she worked frantically at something in the corner. Katja crept closer, curious. Maps. The woman was studying maps by flashlight, looking for escape routes.

Still thinking like prey.

Katja could have killed all three without breaking cover. Easy shots, quick deaths. But where was the artistry in that? The psychological complexity? Viktor appreciated her theatrical flair—it was one of the things that bound them together.

Instead, she chose revelation.

"You missed the most obvious exit," Katja said conversationally, stepping from the shadows with her weapon trained on the group.

The reaction was immediate and professional. The two men spun toward her voice while the Wanderer rolled sideways, coming up with a sidearm in one fluid motion. Fast. Trained. Dangerous.

Exactly what Katja had hoped for.

"Drop your weapons," she continued, as if discussing the weather. "I could have killed you three times over while you were playing soldier."

"Who are you?" The Wanderer's voice was steady despite the tactical disaster. Good. Katja hated it when prey broke too quickly.

"Katja Kozlov. Though most people call me Bloodraven." She kept her rifle steady while studying the masked woman with predatory interest. "You're the famous Wanderer. Viktor speaks of you often."

"Viktor?" One of the men—the big one—shifted his weight. "The Scarred?"

"My lord and lover, yes." Katja smiled, the expression somehow more threatening than a scowl. "He's quite fascinated by your little group. Especially you, masked lady. He finds your... resilience... appealing."

The Wanderer said nothing, but Katja could read the tension in her shoulders, the way her finger rested on the trigger. Calculating odds, looking for advantages. Thinking.

"Your reputation preceded you," Katja continued. "The woman who walks alone, who strikes from shadows and vanishes like smoke. Viktor admires that kind of artistry."

"If you're here to kill us, get on with it," the Wanderer said.

"Kill you?" Katja laughed, the sound carrying genuine amusement. "My dear, I'm here to extend an invitation. Viktor wants to meet you properly. Face to face, as equals."

"We're not equals."

"No," Katja agreed. "You're not. He's the lord of the largest army in Europe, and you're three desperate people hiding in ruins. But he appreciates style, and you have that in abundance."

Outside, the gunfire had stopped. Pavel's team would be moving into position, ready to storm the chapel if negotiations went badly. But Katja was enjoying herself too much to rush toward violence.

"What kind of invitation involves hunting us through the wasteland?" the Wanderer asked.

"The kind that tests worthiness." Katja's eyes never left the other woman's masked face. "Anyone can send a messenger. But to truly know someone's quality, you have to see how they handle pressure. How they move when death is stalking them."

"And your assessment?"

"Impressive. You've evaded us for three days, killed four of our scouts, and led us quite a dance. Viktor will be pleased." Katja paused, tilting her head like a hunting bird. "But the game is over now. Time for the next phase."

The Wanderer's companions were looking between the two women, sensing undercurrents they couldn't quite parse. There was something electric in the air, a recognition between predators that transcended the immediate tactical situation.

"Strip," Katja commanded suddenly.

"What?"

"Your weapons. Remove them slowly and place them on the ground. All of them." Katja's smile turned sharp. "I know you're carrying more than what's visible. The knife in your boot, the garrote in your sleeve, the ceramic blade sewn into your jacket lining. All of it."

The Wanderer hesitated, and Katja could practically see her mind working through possibilities. Finally, slowly, she began complying. Each weapon that emerged—and there were many—earned a nod of professional appreciation from Katja.

"Thorough," Katja approved. "Viktor will want to see your collection. He's something of a connoisseur himself."

When the disarmament was complete, Katja activated her comm. "Pavel. Bring the transport up. We have passengers for the lord."

"The invitation wasn't optional, then," the Wanderer observed.

"The best ones never are." Katja's predatory smile widened. "Don't worry, masked lady. Viktor doesn't kill artists. He collects them."

As Pavel's team entered the chapel, weapons drawn but not threatening, Katja found herself studying the Wanderer with growing interest. There was something about the woman—a controlled violence that matched her own, a refusal to break under pressure that spoke to hidden depths.

Viktor was going to be very pleased indeed.

But as they prepared to leave the ruined chapel, Katja found herself wondering if perhaps Viktor wasn't the only one who would find the Wanderer... compelling.

The thought sent heat through her that had nothing to do with the hunt's successful conclusion.

This was going to be interesting.
