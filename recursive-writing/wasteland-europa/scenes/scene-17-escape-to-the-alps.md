The team successfully escapes Viktor's relentless pursuit by ascending into the high Alpine foothills, using their knowledge of mountain terrain to outmaneuver his forces. Maya leads them through increasingly treacherous paths guided by Elena's legacy knowledge from her research journals, following ancient stone markers toward the hidden sanctuary. The narrative explores their psychological transformation from battle-scarred survivors to hopeful pilgrims, as the pristine Alpine environment begins healing the trauma of recent violence.
