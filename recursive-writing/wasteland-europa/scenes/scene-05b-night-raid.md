## Narrative Summary

**Full narrative available in:** [ðŸ“– Night Raid - Complete Narrative](../narrative/scene-05b-night-raid-narrative.md)

The scene opens with Maya's group sharing a peaceful moment around their campfire when Crimson Horde scouts launch a coordinated nighttime assault. What begins as a quiet evening of bonding becomes a brutal test of survival as Maya demonstrates her tactical leadership and lethal combat skills.

The attack comes from three directions simultaneouslyâ€”professional raiders who've earned their red bandanas through violence. Maya's throwing knife takes down the first scout silently, but the real challenge comes from a seven-foot clan champion wielding a makeshift war hammer who recognizes her as "The Wanderer."

Through visceral combat sequences, Maya proves her evolution from lone survivor to protective leader, using Erik's training to systematically dismantle her opponents. The team proves their worth through coordinated violence, with Sarah taking her first kill and Marcus providing tactical support.

The surviving raider, interrogated before execution, reveals Viktor is sending fifty fightersâ€”a full war party three days behind them. This intelligence forces Maya to accelerate their timeline toward the Channel Tunnel while establishing her growing reputation as a leader who builds armies from the lost and forgotten.

The aftermath sees bodies arranged in ritual patterns as territorial warnings, weapons cleaned, and bonds strengthened through shared bloodshed. Maya's legend grows as her people prove they're not prey, but predators who paint back when threatened.
