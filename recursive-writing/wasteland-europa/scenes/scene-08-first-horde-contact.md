**Summary:** Maya's team emerges from the Channel tunnel to discover the French side is under systematic occupation by Viktor's Crimson Horde forces. What should have been cautious reconnaissance becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse as professional Horde patrols, led by a "Bloodraven" commander, attempt to capture Maya alive on Viktor's orders. The team faces their first encounter with the Horde's evolved military organization—encrypted communications, coordinated tactics, armored vehicles, and intelligence networks capable of tracking specific individuals across continental distances.
