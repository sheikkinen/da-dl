# Wasteland Europa - World Description

## The Great Collapse (2089)
The world ended not with nuclear fire, but with a cascade of environmental and technological failures. Climate change had pushed Europe to the breaking point when the AI-controlled weather modification systems malfunctioned catastrophically. Massive storms, radiation leaks from failing power plants, and bioweapon contamination turned the continent into a hostile wasteland within months.

## Current State (2154 - 65 years post-collapse)
Europe is a patchwork of irradiated zones, toxic storms, and isolated survivor communities. The old borders mean nothing now - the continent is divided by radiation barriers, mutant territories, and the domains of various raider clans and city-states.
