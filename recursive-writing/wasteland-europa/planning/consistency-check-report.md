# Cross-Check Consistency Report - Wasteland Europa

## Date: 2154-06-05
## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

---

## Summary of Cross-Check Analysis

The cross-check between timeline-template.md, scenes-timeline.md, and plots directory has been completed with all major inconsistencies resolved.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Scene Reference Alignment** âœ… FIXED
- **Issue**: Timeline referenced scenes with incorrect file path patterns
- **Resolution**: Updated all timeline scene references to match exact scene filenames
- **Example**: `scenes/channel-crossing` â†’ `scenes/scene-06-into-the-tunnel`

### 2. **Plot vs Scene Type Classification** âœ… FIXED  
- **Issue**: Timeline mixed Plot and Scene types inconsistently
- **Resolution**: 
  - Major plot points marked as "Plot" with references to `/plots/` directory
  - Individual scenes marked as "Scene" with references to `/scenes/` directory
  - Subplot elements maintained as "Scene" but integrated into main timeline flow

### 3. **Missing Plot Files** âœ… CREATED
- **Issue**: Timeline referenced plots that didn't exist in `/plots/` directory
- **Resolution**: Created 4 new plot files to match timeline references:
  - `plots/museum-discovery.md`
  - `plots/paris-underground.md` 
  - `plots/rhine-valley-battle.md`
  - `plots/alpine-sanctuary-discovery.md`

### 4. **Scene File Naming Consistency** âœ… VERIFIED
- **Issue**: Potential mismatches between scene titles and filenames
- **Resolution**: Verified all 21 scene files match the master scenes-timeline.md table
- **Pattern**: All scene files follow `scene-##-title.md` format

### 5. **Subplot Integration** âœ… STREAMLINED
- **Issue**: Timeline had mixed references to scenes and subplots
- **Resolution**: Maintained subplot files as thematic development guides while integrating events into main scene timeline

## Current File Structure Validation

### âœ… Timeline Document (`timeline-template.md`)
- Historical Timeline (2087-2151): 10 entries
- Main Story Timeline (June-August 2154): 21 entries  
- Development Timeline (Meta): 4 entries
- All scene references now match actual filenames
- Plot references point to existing plot files

### âœ… Scenes Master Table (`scenes-timeline.md`)
- 21 scenes organized across 3 acts
- Status tracking: 7 detailed âœ…, 14 templates ðŸ“‹
- All scene files exist and are properly linked
- Act breakdown properly maintained

### âœ… Plot Files (`/plots/` directory)
- 5 total plot files (1 main + 4 supporting)
- Main plot: `the-europa-crossing.md` (overall story arc)
- Supporting plots: Discovery, Paris, Rhine Battle, Alpine Discovery
- All referenced plots now exist

### âœ… Scene Files (`/scenes/` directory)
- 21 scene files: `scene-01-museum-discovery.md` through `scene-21-return-journey.md`
- 7 detailed scenes with full content
- 14 template scenes ready for development
- Consistent internal structure across all files

### âœ… Subplot Files (`/subplots/` directory)

## Development Timeline Updates

The following entries have been added to the Development Timeline section:

| Date | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 2025-06-05 | Scene file system creation | Generated 21 individual scene files with master navigation table |
| 2025-06-05 | Cross-check consistency verification | Verified and corrected timeline, scenes, and plots alignment |
| 2025-06-05 | Plot file completion | Created 4 additional plot files for complete timeline integration |

## Next Steps Recommended

1. **Scene Development**: Continue developing the 14 template scenes into full detailed scenes
2. **Plot Expansion**: Add more detailed plot breakdowns as scenes are developed  
3. **Character Integration**: Ensure character arcs align with scene and plot development
4. **World Building Consistency**: Verify locations, factions, and artifacts align with timeline events

## Quality Assurance

- âœ… All timeline events have corresponding files
- âœ… All scene files exist and are properly named
- âœ… All plot references point to existing files
- âœ… No broken links or orphaned references
- âœ… Consistent file naming patterns throughout
- âœ… Proper chronological ordering maintained
- âœ… Act structure properly maintained across all documents

**Final Status**: All timeline, scenes-timeline, and plots are now fully consistent and cross-referenced.
