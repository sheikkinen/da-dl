# Verification Action Plan - Immediate Tasks

**Created:** December 19, 2024  
**Project:** Wasteland Europa - Final Quality Assurance  
**Status:** 30/30 scenes complete (100%), ready for final verification

---

## Current State Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **Manual Verification Plan** - Comprehensive 7-phase protocol in `plan-manual-verification.md`
2. **Project Summary** - Complete story overview in `europa-summary.md`
3. **Automated Verification Tools** - 4 scripts for consistency checking
4. **Initial Automated Analysis** - Issues identified and documented

### üîç Current Issues Identified

#### Person Consistency Issues (11 files)
The automated checker flagged 11 files with "low third person usage," but manual review shows these are **FALSE POSITIVES**:

**Issue**: Pattern matching counts dialogue pronouns ("I", "you") as POV violations
**Reality**: Files use proper third-person limited POV with natural dialogue
**Action Required**: Manual verification to confirm POV consistency

**Flagged Files:**
- `scene-05-brotherhood-of-survivors-narrative.md` (52% third person - dialogue heavy)
- `scene-08b-katja-hunt-narrative.md` (65% third person - dialogue heavy)
- `scene-13b-gathering-storm-narrative.md` (66% third person - dialogue heavy)
- `scene-14-scarred-lord-narrative.md` (46% third person - dialogue heavy)
- `scene-16-walking-apocalypse-narrative.md` (37% third person - dialogue heavy)
- `scene-16b-bloodlust-desire-narrative.md` (63% third person - dialogue heavy)
- `scene-17-escape-to-the-alps-narrative.md` (29% third person - dialogue heavy)
- `scene-18-alpine-sanctuary-discovery-narrative.md` (36% third person - dialogue heavy)
- `scene-19-the-keeper-s-test-narrative.md` (51% third person - dialogue heavy)
- `scene-20-the-stargazer-s-choice-narrative.md` (51% third person - dialogue heavy)
- `scene-21-return-journey-narrative.md` (unknown % - needs check)

#### Tense Consistency Issues (1 file)
- `scene-18-alpine-sanctuary-discovery-narrative.md` (63% past tense)
  - **Issue**: Uses present tense for dramatic effect ("The sanctuary's entrance revealed itself to us")
  - **Assessment**: Likely acceptable for narrative style
  - **Action**: Manual review for consistency

#### Metadata Issues (1 file)
- `scene-03b-blood-and-steel-narrative.md` - Missing date metadata

#### Word Count Status
- **Current**: 59,761 words
- **Target**: 75,000+ words  
- **Gap**: ~15,239 words needed
- **Action**: Verify count accuracy, consider scene expansions

## Immediate Action Items

### Phase 1: Resolve Metadata Issue ‚ö°
- [ ] Add missing date metadata to `scene-03b-blood-and-steel-narrative.md`

### Phase 2: Manual POV Verification üìñ
- [ ] Manually review the 11 flagged files for actual POV consistency
- [ ] Document findings: Confirm third-person limited POV maintenance
- [ ] Note any actual POV violations that need correction

### Phase 3: Tense Review üìù
- [ ] Review `scene-18-alpine-sanctuary-discovery-narrative.md` for tense consistency
- [ ] Determine if present tense usage is stylistically appropriate

### Phase 4: Word Count Analysis üìä
- [ ] Verify actual word count vs. target
- [ ] Identify scenes that could benefit from expansion
- [ ] Consider if current length meets project goals

### Phase 5: Final Quality Check ‚úÖ
- [ ] Run automated tools after fixes
- [ ] Generate final verification report
- [ ] Complete manual verification checklist
