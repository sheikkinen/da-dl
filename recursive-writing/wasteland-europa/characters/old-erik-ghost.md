Erik appears in Maya's memories and internal monologue throughout the story, representing her moral compass and the voice of wisdom. His influence becomes stronger when Maya faces difficult choices, reminding her that survival alone isn't enough - one must also preserve humanity and hope. His teachings about navigation become metaphors for Maya's journey toward understanding her true purpose. His memory helps Maya choose sacrifice over safety in the story's climax, as she remembers his lessons about serving something greater than oneself.
