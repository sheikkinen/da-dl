# Viktor "The Scarred" Kozlov

## Name:
Viktor Kozlov, known as "The Scarred" for the ritual scarification covering his face and arms

## Role/Archetype:
Warlord/Antagonist - The brutal leader of the Crimson Horde who rules through fear and strength

## Physical Description:
Early 40s, imposing figure at 6'4" with a heavily muscled frame. His most striking feature is the network of ritual scars covering the left side of his face and both arms - each scar represents a victory in combat or a settlement conquered. Shaved head with a braided beard adorned with metal rings. Wears piecemeal armor made from salvaged military gear and sports car parts, painted crimson. Never seen without his signature weapon: a modified chainsaw sword.

## Personality Traits:
- Charismatic leader who inspires fanatical loyalty
- Strategic mind beneath the savage exterior
- Believes strength is the only truth in the wasteland
- Surprisingly cultured - quotes pre-war literature and history
- Paranoid about betrayal, constantly testing his followers

## Motivations/Goals:
Primary: Control the Alpine sanctuary to become the wasteland's supreme ruler
Secondary: Prove that civilization is weakness and only the strong deserve to survive
Hidden: Seeks to validate his father's pre-war military theories about social Darwinism

## Key Relationships:
- His lieutenant Katja "Bloodraven" - the only person he trusts
- Complicated respect/hatred for Maya as a worthy adversary
- Bitter rivalry with other raider clans
- Contempt for settled communities and "soft" survivors

## Backstory:
Son of a pre-war military theorist who believed civilization made humanity weak. Born in the early years after the Collapse in a militaristic survivor community that eventually fell to raiders. Viktor killed his community's weak leaders as a teenager and took control, gradually building the Crimson Horde through conquest and recruitment. Has spent 20 years turning his father's theories into brutal reality.

## Abilities/Skills:
- Master tactician and battlefield commander
- Exceptional fighter with both ranged and melee weapons
- Intimidation and psychological warfare expertise
- Mechanical aptitude - maintains the Horde's vehicles personally
- Surprisingly well-read in military history and philosophy
- Ability to inspire fanatical loyalty in followers

## Conflicts/Flaws:
- Obsessed with proving his father's theories correct
- Paranoia leads him to eliminate potentially loyal followers
- Inability to show weakness makes him push injured limits
- Contempt for "weakness" blinds him to strategic value of mercy
- Deep fear that he might be wrong about strength being everything

## Arc/Development Notes:
Viktor begins as Maya's primary antagonist but evolves into a more complex figure - a man whose brutal philosophy stems from genuine belief rather than simple cruelty. His final confrontation with Maya forces him to confront whether strength alone can build something lasting, or if it only destroys. His defeat comes not from being overpowered, but from realizing his philosophy's fundamental emptiness when faced with Maya's courage and sacrifice.
