## Backstory:
Former environmental engineer who worked on the climate modification systems before the Collapse. Lost her family in the early chaos and spent years blaming herself for the technological failures. Found purpose in the Parisian underground, establishing a hidden research facility in the abandoned Sorbonne. Has spent 20 years collecting and preserving scientific knowledge while developing technologies to help survivors. Connected to the Alpine sanctuary through encrypted communications.
