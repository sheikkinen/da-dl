## AI Friendly Summary
**File Purpose**: [Brief description of what this file contains and why it exists]
**Content Overview**: [Summary of main sections and key information]
**Dependencies**: [What other files this depends on or relates to]
**Usage Context**: [When and how this file is used in the workflow]
```

**Bidirectional References**: When File A references File B, File B should also reference File A
**Format**: Use relative paths and descriptive link text
**Example**: `See [Character Arc Development](./character-arc-development.md) for detailed character progression analysis`
**Validation**: All cross-references should be verified for accuracy and reciprocity

#### Markdown Tools Usage Standards
**Tables**: Use for character matrices, timeline data, scene tracking
