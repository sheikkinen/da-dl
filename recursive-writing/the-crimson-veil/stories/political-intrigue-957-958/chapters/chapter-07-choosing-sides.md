The morning summons arrived in formal diplomatic language that barely concealed the ultimatum beneath its courteous phrasing. Princess Lyanna's representatives requested Lady Lucretia's "immediate consultation regarding foreign diplomatic perspectives on succession legitimacy and political stability." Prince Marcus's faction had sent similar language an hour earlier, as had Prince Edward's supporters. Each message carried the same underlying demand: choose your side in the succession crisis, because neutrality was no longer an option.

Lucretia stood before the tall windows of her diplomatic chambers, watching the capital's morning activity while mentally preparing for the day that would transform her from neutral observer to committed political actor. Six months ago, she had arrived expecting to manage routine trade discussions. Today, she would choose which claimant to the throne received Corvinian diplomatic support—and more importantly, which side would benefit from the alliance she had built with Cassius and Gareth.

"Political reality," she murmured, using the analytical framework that had guided her diplomatic career. "Neutrality becomes impossible when all parties demand commitment."

The first meeting was scheduled with Princess Lyanna's representatives in the royal council chambers—a location chosen to emphasize legitimate authority and traditional succession rights. Lord Chancellor Roderick led the delegation, his demeanor carrying the careful balance of respect and urgency that characterized experienced political operators.

"Lady Corvina," he began without diplomatic preamble, "the kingdom requires clear commitment from all foreign representatives regarding succession legitimacy. Continued neutrality serves only those who benefit from political instability."

The demand was straightforward: public Corvinian recognition of Princess Lyanna as rightful heir, diplomatic support for her claim, and coordination with her political supporters. In return, favorable trade agreements, security cooperation, and preferential status in the new administration.

"Princess Lyanna represents constitutional legitimacy," Roderick continued, presenting arguments she had heard variations of for weeks. "Traditional succession law, royal designation, and institutional support through established governmental structures."

Lucretia listened with professional attention while assessing the political calculation beneath the diplomatic language. Princess Lyanna possessed legitimate claim and institutional support, but lacked the military strength and political ruthlessness that might be necessary for success in a contested succession.

The second meeting took place in Prince Marcus's temporary headquarters in the military district, where armed guards and martial efficiency emphasized strength and decisiveness over constitutional niceties. Commander Erik Stormwind presented the prince's case with blunt effectiveness.

"Lady Corvina, political legitimacy comes from ability to govern effectively, not from inherited titles alone," he stated with military directness. "Prince Marcus commands loyalty from the military and eastern duchies because he demonstrates competence and strength."

The offer was generous: expanded trade territories, military protection agreements, and significant political influence in a Marcus administration. But the cost was clear—commitment to supporting a succession based on strength rather than traditional legitimacy, with all the precedent that choice would establish.

"Constitutional law matters less than political reality," Stormwind continued. "Prince Marcus can maintain stability and defend the kingdom against foreign interference. Can the other claimants make the same claim?"

By midday, Lucretia had endured similar presentations from Prince Edward's supporters, each emphasizing different aspects of legitimacy, capability, and political advantage. The pattern was consistent: choose our side now, receive significant benefits, but commit completely to our success regardless of consequences.

She made her way to the secure coordination chamber where Cassius and Gareth waited with their own assessments of the political demands and strategic implications. The alliance that had developed through crisis management now faced its greatest test—coordinated decision making under ultimate political pressure.

"Analysis," she said without preamble as she settled into the chair positioned for secure conversation. "Each faction has made their final offers and demands."

Cassius spread intelligence documents across the table with systematic precision. "Intelligence assessment suggests Princess Lyanna has constitutional legitimacy but questionable military support. Prince Marcus commands significant armed loyalty but lacks traditional legal claim. Prince Edward possesses wealth and southern alliance support but limited popular backing."

Gareth added military perspective with professional competence. "Defense implications favor Marcus for external threats, Lyanna for internal stability, Edward for economic warfare capability. Each choice creates different vulnerabilities and strategic advantages."

They spent two hours analyzing the succession candidates through alliance priorities: effectiveness in governing, ability to resist foreign interference, and compatibility with their intelligence-diplomatic coordination approach. The assessment revealed uncomfortable truths about each option.

"Personal consultation," Lucretia said finally, addressing the elephant in the room. "This decision affects not just diplomatic relations, but our alliance partnership and individual safety."

The choice would determine their political positioning for the duration of the succession crisis. Supporting the eventual winner meant influence and protection. Supporting the loser meant potential exile, imprisonment, or worse. The personal stakes had escalated beyond professional considerations to literal survival.

"Alliance framework assessment," Cassius replied with characteristic analytical detachment. "Our partnership provides capabilities that any succession candidate would value. Intelligence operations, diplomatic expertise, military coordination. We represent strategic assets regardless of specific political positioning."

"But some candidates are more compatible with alliance values and operational requirements than others," Gareth added. "Our choice should reflect both practical necessity and strategic compatibility."

The afternoon brought devastating news that eliminated their careful analysis and forced immediate decision making. Ambassador Kieran Blackthorn had presented formal demands to all succession candidates: accept Eastern Empire "assistance" in resolving the succession crisis, or face economic and military pressure until a more "reasonable" approach emerged.

Foreign interference had escalated from influence operations to open intervention threats. The succession crisis was no longer a domestic political matter, but an international conflict where neighboring kingdoms would determine the outcome unless the kingdom's defenders acted decisively.

"Diplomatic breakdown," Lucretia assessed with professional certainty. "Traditional negotiation approaches have completely failed. Foreign powers are moving to direct intervention."

The alliance faced a choice that transcended succession preferences. They could support whichever candidate offered the best resistance to foreign intervention, or they could prioritize other factors and hope their choice proved capable of defending kingdom independence.

"Intelligence indicates Princess Lyanna would resist foreign pressure through diplomatic and legal channels," Cassius reported. "Prince Marcus would resist through military confrontation. Prince Edward would attempt to negotiate accommodation with foreign demands."

The decision crystallized with remarkable clarity. Foreign intervention represented exactly the threat their alliance had formed to address. Supporting the candidate most likely to resist such intervention was consistent with their fundamental objectives regardless of other political considerations.

"Princess Lyanna," Lucretia said with diplomatic certainty. "Constitutional legitimacy, resistance to foreign pressure, and compatibility with alliance coordination approaches."

The choice felt both inevitable and transformative. Inevitable because their alliance priorities made other options strategically incompatible. Transformative because it represented final commitment to political action rather than neutral observation.

"Alliance coordination confirmed," Gareth replied with military satisfaction. "Princess Lyanna receives intelligence support, diplomatic coordination, and military alliance recommendation."

As evening approached, they finalized the operational framework that would govern their political commitment. Public diplomatic recognition, private intelligence coordination, and alliance integration with Lyanna's political organization. The neutral diplomat had become a committed political player through alliance partnership and strategic necessity.

"Personal assessment," Lucretia reflected as they completed their coordination planning. "Six months ago, I sought to avoid political entanglement through careful neutrality. Tonight, I'm committing to political alliance through strategic partnership."

The transformation felt less like betrayal of diplomatic principles than like finally understanding the real nature of international relations. Politics was warfare conducted through alternative means, and effective diplomacy required acknowledging that reality rather than pretending it didn't exist.

"Professional evolution," Cassius observed with analytical accuracy. "Political crisis reveals true requirements for effective diplomatic work. Alliance coordination becomes essential rather than optional."

As they departed the coordination chamber for the formal ceremony where Lucretia would announce Corvinian support for Princess Lyanna's succession claim, she reflected on the path that had brought her to this moment. Diplomatic assignment had become political commitment. Professional cooperation had become alliance partnership. Neutral observation had become strategic action.

The succession crisis would escalate into open conflict—intelligence suggested that was inevitable regardless of their choices. But their alliance would face that conflict with clear political positioning, coordinated capabilities, and strategic framework for effective action.

Foreign intervention had forced domestic political commitment. Traditional approaches had failed, requiring alliance coordination and strategic partnership. The neutral diplomat was gone, replaced by a political leader committed to defending kingdom independence through whatever means proved necessary.

Act I of the succession crisis was complete. Act II would test whether their political commitment could translate into effective action when diplomatic breakdown led inevitably to civil war.
