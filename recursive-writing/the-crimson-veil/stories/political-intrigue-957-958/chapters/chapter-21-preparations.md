# Chapter 21: Preparations

*Mid 958 AV, Month 16*  
*Alliance Military Command Center*

The sound of boots on stone echoed through the pre-dawn darkness as Gareth Ironhold made his way to the command center. One month had passed since diplomacy had breathed its last in that sterile conference chamber, and in that time the Alliance had transformed from a political coalition into a war machine. Today would mark the completion of that transformation—the final day of preparation before the storm broke.

Dawn reveille was already sounding across the military compound as Gareth entered the central command room. Maps covered every surface, marked with troop positions, supply lines, and enemy intelligence. Red pins showed Prince Marcus's forces, blue represented the Alliance, and the growing clusters of markers told the story of a kingdom dividing itself for war.

"Morning report, Captain Thorne," Gareth called to his senior infantry commander.

Marcus Thorne stepped forward with the crisp precision that had made him invaluable during these months of preparation. "All units at full strength, Commander. Equipment inspections completed at 0500 hours. Morale is... excellent, sir. The men are ready."

Ready. Such a simple word for such a complex reality. Ready meant trained soldiers who could hold formation under arrow fire. Ready meant supply lines that could feed an army in the field. Ready meant men who had made peace with the possibility of dying for their cause.

"Intelligence update?" Gareth asked, turning to where Cassius stood examining reconnaissance reports.

"Enemy strength estimates remain consistent," the intelligence officer replied. "Marcus has approximately forty percent of the regular army, plus mercenary companies totaling another eight thousand men. Quality is... mixed. His mercenaries are experienced but have questionable loyalty. Our forces are smaller but more cohesive."

## The Strategic Session

The morning strategic planning session brought together the Alliance's senior military leadership in a display of professional competence that would have been impossible to imagine a year ago. These men had served together in peacetime, but war had forged them into something new—a command structure united by shared purpose rather than mere duty.

"Final deployment positions," Gareth announced, spreading the master tactical map across the central table. "First Infantry Division takes the northern approach. Cavalry reserves maintain central position for rapid deployment. Artillery positions here and here, with overlapping fields of fire."

Each commander acknowledged their assignments with the calm confidence of officers who had spent weeks perfecting these plans. No hesitation, no uncertainty—just the deadly professionalism of men who knew their trade.

"Contingency plans remain as discussed," he continued. "If Marcus attempts to force the capital before we can consolidate, Second Division falls back to defensive positions while cavalry harasses their flanks. If they try to avoid direct engagement, we pursue with full force and bring them to battle on our terms."

Captain Thorne leaned forward. "Rules of engagement for civilian areas, sir?"

"Minimum necessary force. We're fighting to restore the kingdom, not destroy it. But make it clear to all commanders—we cannot show weakness. Any hesitation will be seen as divided loyalty."

## Among the Troops

The morning inspection rounds took Gareth through every section of the Alliance forces, and what he saw filled him with a pride that transcended mere professional satisfaction. These were his soldiers—men he had trained, disciplined, and prepared for this moment.

In the infantry barracks, veterans shared equipment-cleaning duties with newer recruits, the easy camaraderie of shared purpose evident in every interaction. No one complained about the early hours or the constant drills. They understood what was at stake.

"Nervous about tomorrow, lad?" Gareth asked a young soldier who couldn't have seen more than eighteen winters.

"No sir," the boy replied, and Gareth was struck by the steady certainty in his voice. "We know what we're fighting for. That's more than the other side can say."

Truth, delivered with the simplicity that often marked the most profound insights. These men weren't fighting for abstractions—they were fighting for the kingdom they believed in, led by commanders they trusted, alongside comrades who had become brothers.

"Good man," Gareth said, moving on through the ranks.

## Weapons and Readiness

The armory inspection revealed the fruits of months of careful preparation. Weapons had been sharpened to perfection, maintained with the obsessive care that marked professional soldiers. Supply wagons stood loaded and ready, medical supplies organized with military precision, siege equipment positioned for rapid deployment.

Supply Master Elena greeted him with the satisfied expression of someone whose systems had proven themselves flawless. "Everything accounted for, Commander. Provisions for two months of campaigning, replacement equipment for forty percent casualties, medical supplies calculated for extended operations."

"Forty percent casualties," Gareth repeated. The number hung in the air between them—a cold recognition of war's arithmetic.

"Better to prepare for the worst and find ourselves fortunate," Elena replied pragmatically. "Though I suspect this conflict will be decided quickly, one way or another."

Probably true. Civil wars rarely dragged on when both sides possessed professional armies. The kingdom would have its answer soon enough.

## Final Training

The afternoon training exercises showcased everything the Alliance forces had become. Infantry formations moved with the precision of clockwork, cavalry charges demonstrated devastating coordination, and the integration between different units spoke to months of intensive preparation.

But it was more than technical competence that impressed Gareth as he watched from the command platform. It was the esprit de corps, the infectious confidence that marked soldiers who trusted their leaders and believed in their cause. When the trumpet sounded for formation changes, the response was instantaneous. When officers called for volunteers for dangerous assignments, hands shot up without hesitation.

"They're ready," Captain Thorne observed, joining him on the platform.

"More than ready," Gareth agreed. "They're eager. That can be dangerous."

"Not with proper leadership. And they trust you, Commander. That makes all the difference."

Trust. Another simple word for a complex reality. These men would follow his orders into battle, would charge enemy positions on his command, would die for decisions he made in the heat of combat. The weight of that trust was both humbling and strengthening.

## Evening Coordination

The final command conference brought together not just Alliance military leaders, but representatives from every supporting organization that would contribute to the war effort. Intelligence networks, supply coordinators, medical corps, engineering specialists—all the complex infrastructure that modern warfare demanded.

"Final intelligence assessment," Gareth called the meeting to order. "Enemy capabilities, probable strategies, potential surprises."

Cassius provided a comprehensive briefing that demonstrated the thoroughness of Alliance preparation. Enemy troop dispositions, supply line vulnerabilities, command structure analysis, probable tactical approaches—nothing had been left to chance.

"Their greatest weakness remains the mercenary question," he concluded. "Hired soldiers fight differently than men defending their homeland. When the battle turns difficult, their loyalty becomes... negotiable."

"Our greatest strength," added Captain Thorne, "is unit cohesion. Our soldiers know each other, trust each other, and will fight to protect each other as much as for the larger cause."

As the evening briefings concluded and the various specialists departed to their final preparations, Gareth found himself alone in the command center with its maps and markers and endless tactical details. Tomorrow, all of this planning would meet the harsh reality of battle.

## Personal Preparation

In the quiet of his private quarters, Gareth performed his own final rituals of preparation. Weapons cleaned and sharpened with personal care, armor inspected and adjusted, personal effects arranged with the methodical attention of a soldier who knew that some preparations were made only once.

A letter to his family, sealed and left with instructions for delivery if needed. Final tactical notes for his subordinates, contingency plans within contingency plans. The administrative details of command that continued even in the face of mortality.

But mostly, he thought about the men who would follow him tomorrow. Young soldiers like the eighteen-year-old he had spoken with, confident in their cause. Veterans who had chosen the Alliance over the safe path of neutrality. Officers who had trusted his leadership enough to stake their careers on this moment.

They deserved the best commander he could be. They deserved victory.

Through his window, he could see the lights of the military compound—soldiers completing their own preparations, officers reviewing final orders, support staff ensuring that every detail was perfect. The Alliance war machine, ready to prove itself against the ultimate test.

Tomorrow would bring the War of the Crimson Veil. Tonight, they were as ready as mortal men could be.
