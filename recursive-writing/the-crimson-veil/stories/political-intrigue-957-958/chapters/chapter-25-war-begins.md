# Chapter 25: War Begins

*A narrative chapter adapted from Scene 25 specifications*

Dawn broke over the Thornfield Plain with deceptive serenity, painting the frost-covered grass in shades of gold that would soon be stained with blood. Lucretia Aurelia Corvina stood on the low ridge that served as Princess Lyanna's command position, watching three thousand allied troops arrange themselves in battle formation while foreign banners glittered in the distance like deadly promises.

Eighteen months of political maneuvering had led to this moment—diplomacy abandoned, negotiations exhausted, and the future of the kingdom to be decided by the ancient arbitrator of force. She pulled her military cloak tighter against the morning chill, surprised by how natural the weight of command felt on shoulders that had once carried only the burden of neutrality.

"Intelligence confirms enemy strength at four thousand five hundred," Cassius reported, materializing beside her with the silent efficiency that had made him invaluable. "Three thousand Vaelthorne regulars, fifteen hundred Dornish cavalry, and perhaps a thousand domestic supporters. They've positioned Prince Marcus with the center command, flying royal banners."

"Flying stolen banners," Lucretia corrected, accepting the detailed reconnaissance reports he offered. "Those are our colors they're displaying, not his."

Through her field glass, she could see the enemy formations taking shape across the plain—foreign discipline evident in their precise positioning, siege engines that spoke of coordinated planning, and cavalry that outnumbered their own mounted forces two to one. But their own troops carried something the enemy lacked: the desperate unity of people fighting for independence.

"General Harrison reports ready," Gareth Ironhold announced, approaching with the confident stride of a man who had spent his life preparing for exactly this moment. "Princess Lyanna has taken position with the reserves. She insists on sharing the risks her people face."

Lucretia nodded approval. The princess had proven her political courage through months of alliance building; now she would prove her personal courage in battle. "Signal positions. All commands report ready when prepared."

The transformation still amazed her. Eighteen months ago, she had been a neutral diplomat seeking peaceful resolution to political disputes. Now she stood as military coordinator for an alliance fighting to preserve their kingdom's independence. The change felt less like loss than like finally becoming who the crisis required her to be.

"Movement on the enemy left flank," Cassius observed, his trained eyes catching tactical shifts others might miss. "They're reinforcing their cavalry wing. Probably planning to hit our right with mounted charge while their center advances."

"Standard foreign tactics," Gareth agreed. "Overwhelming force concentrated at the perceived weak point. They're counting on quick victory before our troops can demonstrate their commitment."

Lucretia studied the enemy deployments through her field glass, applying the strategic thinking that diplomatic training had developed. "They expect us to break under pressure because they assume we're fighting for political ambition rather than survival. They don't understand that we're defending independence, not supporting a claimant."

The morning sun climbed higher, burning off the frost and revealing the full scope of the battlefield. Two armies faced each other across ground that would determine whether their kingdom remained sovereign or became a client state serving foreign masters. The weight of every political choice she had made seemed concentrated in this single moment of decision.

"Signal the advance," she ordered.

War horns echoed across the plain, carrying commands that had been planned in careful detail but would be executed in the chaos of combat. Their infantry moved forward in formations that reflected months of preparation, while cavalry positioned for tactical response rather than charge. They lacked the enemy's overwhelming force, but possessed the advantage of fighting for something they understood.

The enemy response was immediate and professional. Foreign trumpets answered their advance, and across the plain, disciplined troops began their own movement with the precision of soldiers who had conducted similar operations in other kingdoms, for other puppet monarchs.

"Here they come," Gareth announced unnecessarily.

The Dornish cavalry struck their right flank with the thunderous impact of fifteen hundred mounted warriors determined to end the battle quickly. But their own troops had prepared for exactly this assault, pikemen bracing spears while archers launched volleys that disrupted enemy formation before contact.

Lucretia watched the tactical dance unfold, her diplomatic training allowing her to read the larger patterns while Gareth managed immediate tactical responses. The enemy possessed superior numbers and equipment, but their own forces demonstrated the coordination of people who had chosen to fight together rather than been commanded to do so.

"Cassius!" she called over the growing battle noise. "Enemy center movement?"

"Advancing steadily. Prince Marcus remains with their command group, foreign advisors directing the tactical evolution." His voice carried professional assessment without emotion. "They're coordinating well, but they're following a predetermined plan rather than adapting to our responses."

Which was exactly what they had hoped for. Foreign military doctrine emphasized overwhelming force applied according to established patterns, while their own strategy relied on flexibility and local knowledge. The question was whether adaptation could overcome raw power.

The battle developed across the morning with the deadly beauty of coordinated violence. Infantry clashed with the ring of steel on steel, cavalry wheeled and charged in tactical patterns that painted dust clouds across the plain, and archers sent volleys that whistled overhead like deadly rain.

Through it all, Lucretia found herself thinking not of the immediate tactical situation but of the larger forces this battle represented. Foreign intervention designed to install a compliant monarchy. Domestic collaboration in exchange for personal advantage. And their own alliance's desperate attempt to preserve independence through military resistance.

"Princess Lyanna signals victory on the left," Gareth reported, his voice carrying satisfaction and relief in equal measure. "Enemy infantry falling back in good order, but falling back nonetheless."

"Center holding?" she asked, watching the main battle through smoke that was beginning to obscure the field.

"Better than holding. Advancing. Their foreign advisors didn't anticipate our troops' willingness to take casualties for strategic advantage."

But even as he spoke, Lucretia noticed something that made her breath catch. The sky above the battlefield was changing—not clouds, but a reddish haze that seemed to shimmer with its own light. The phenomenon was subtle at first, barely visible through the smoke and dust of combat, but growing more pronounced as the morning progressed.

"Cassius," she said quietly, "are you seeing atmospheric changes?"

He followed her gaze to the sky, his expression shifting from tactical assessment to wonder. "That's... not natural weather, is it?"

The reddish haze was spreading across the battlefield like a vast banner, tinting the morning light with colors that seemed to pulse with their own rhythm. Soldiers on both sides began pointing at the sky, some pausing in their combat to stare at the unprecedented phenomenon.

"The Crimson Veil," Gareth whispered, using a term none of them had heard before but which somehow felt appropriate. "It's like the sky itself is marking this moment."

Whether supernatural force or atmospheric coincidence, the effect was undeniable. The battle continued beneath a sky that seemed to acknowledge the historical significance of their conflict—the moment when their kingdom's independence would be preserved or lost forever.

By midday, the outcome was becoming clear. The enemy possessed superior numbers and equipment, but their own forces demonstrated tactical flexibility and strategic commitment that foreign doctrine couldn't anticipate. Prince Marcus's supporters began withdrawing from positions they couldn't hold, while foreign advisors found their predetermined plans inadequate for the reality of fighting people defending their homes.

"Victory," Gareth announced as enemy formations began general withdrawal. "Not complete, not final, but victory nonetheless."

Lucretia watched the enemy retreat across fields marked by the evidence of their first engagement in what would clearly be a longer conflict. This battle was won, but the war was just beginning. Foreign powers wouldn't abandon their investment because of a single tactical defeat, and domestic collaborators wouldn't cease their efforts to install a compliant monarchy.

"Status report," she ordered, already thinking beyond immediate tactical success to strategic requirements.

"Casualties moderate, morale excellent, equipment adequate," Gareth summarized with professional efficiency. "We can hold this position or advance, depending on strategic assessment."

"Princess Lyanna's orders?"

"Continue the campaign. Drive foreign forces from our territory and establish the principle that our kingdom won't accept puppet monarchy."

Above them, the crimson haze in the sky continued its mysterious display, as if the very atmosphere acknowledged that this day marked the beginning of something larger than local succession politics. This was the first day of what would become known as the War of the Crimson Veil—a conflict that would determine not just who ruled their kingdom, but whether small nations could preserve independence in a world of expanding empires.

Lucretia looked across the battlefield where political choices had finally become military reality, where eighteen months of careful alliance building had proven itself in the ultimate test of armed conflict. The diplomat who had sought peaceful resolution was gone, replaced by a war leader who understood that some principles could only be defended through force.

"Prepare for continued operations," she ordered, her voice carrying the authority of someone who had found her true calling. "This is only the beginning."
