## Role/Archetype:
Idealistic Ruler, Righteous Claimant, Benevolent King, Military Leader

## Physical Description:
A man in his early thirties with the noble bearing expected of royal blood, yet possessing an accessibility that draws common folk to his cause. Prince Gareth has auburn hair typical of his Welsh lineage and warm brown eyes that reflect genuine concern for others' welfare. His face bears a few scars from battles fought personally alongside his men, refusing the safety of distant command. He dresses simply for a prince, preferring practical clothing that allows him to move freely among his people. His most distinctive feature is his smile - warm, genuine, and completely without artifice.

## Backstory:
Born into the ancient Aurelian royal house but raised in humble circumstances during political upheaval in his youth.

The Brotherhood Oath of 958 AV with Cassius Ferox and Brennos mac Cuinn formed life-changing bonds across cultural boundaries.
