# Cross-Check Analysis: Political Intrigue Story Development
*Date: June 6, 2025*
*Analysis of current state vs. planned action items*

## AI Friendly Summary
**File Purpose**: Provides comprehensive cross-check analysis of political intrigue story development progress, tracking completed vs. missing files, identifying gaps in documentation, and validating consistency across all story elements.

**Content Overview**: Documents current completion state of core planning documents, scene breakdowns, character files, universe integration, identifies missing priority files organized by phases, tracks infrastructure status, and provides quality assurance validation for story coherence.

**Dependencies**: References all story files for completeness checking including `action-plan.md`, scene breakdowns, character development, plot mapping, timeline, and historical context. Validates against universe bible requirements and cross-reference standards.

**Usage Context**: Used by project managers for progress tracking, by editors for quality assurance validation, by writers for identifying missing dependencies, and by coordinators for ensuring comprehensive story development before drafting begins.

## DISCREPANCIES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Character Name Inconsistencies
**Issue**: Universe characters have different names than action plan references
- Universe: `gareth-aurelius-prince.md` 
- Action Plan: `gareth-ironhold` (refers to different character concept)
- Universe: `cassius-ferox-commander.md`
- Action Plan: `cassius` (simplified reference)

**Resolution Needed**: Align character references or clarify if these are different characters

### 2. Missing Acts Directory
**Issue**: Action plan references `acts/` directory but it doesn't exist
**Resolution**: Create `acts/` directory and act structure files

### 3. Characters Directory Missing
**Issue**: Action plan references `characters/` directory for story-specific character files
**Resolution**: Create `characters/` directory for story-specific character development

### 4. Template Integration Workflow
**Issue**: Action plan references using `copy_template.mjs` but workflow not established
**Resolution**: Need to execute template copying workflow as planned

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Create Missing Directories
```bash
mkdir -p acts
mkdir -p characters
mkdir -p plots
```

### Step 2: Priority 1 Execution (Foundation Files)
1. Create `act-2-scene-breakdown.md` (IMMEDIATE)
2. Create `act-3-scene-breakdown.md` (IMMEDIATE)
3. Create three act structure files
4. Use `copy_template.mjs` to create 7 character files
5. Populate character templates with story-specific details

### Step 3: Resolve Character Reference Issues
1. Clarify character name mappings between universe and story
2. Update action plan or create aliases for consistency
3. Ensure cross-reference accuracy

### Step 4: Execute Phase B (Structural Development)
1. Create 5 plot files using templates
2. Split existing large files into focused documents
3. Create character arc individual files

## COMPLETION METRICS

**Total Files Planned**: 50+ files across 4 phases
**Total Files Created**: 8 core planning files (16% complete)
**Immediate Priority**: 12 foundation files (Phase A)
**Critical Blocker**: Missing Act 2 & 3 scene breakdowns

**Estimated Completion Timeline**:
- Phase A (Foundation): 1-2 days
- Phase B (Structural): 2-3 days  
- Phase C (Detailed): 3-4 days
- Phase D (Integration): 1-2 days
- **Total**: 7-11 days for complete planning foundation

## QUALITY ASSURANCE NOTES

**Strengths of Current Work**:
- Comprehensive action plan with detailed iterative tasks
- Strong foundation in character development and plot mapping
- Excellent timeline integration with universe
- Good cross-reference system started

**Areas Needing Attention**:
- Character name consistency across universe and story
- Template-based file creation workflow execution
- Scene breakdown completion for Acts 2 & 3
- Directory structure completion

**Risk Factors**:
- Large number of missing files could delay narrative generation
- Character reference inconsistencies could create confusion
- Missing scene breakdowns block individual scene file creation
