# Chapter 7: Choosing Sides - Summary

**Timeline**: Mid 957 AV, Month 2  
**Location**: Court chambers, diplomatic quarters, intelligence networks  
**Key Characters**: Lucretia Corvina, Cassius, all succession claimants, foreign ambassadors

## Chapter Summary

As the succession crisis intensifies, court factions solidify around different claimants, forcing individuals and institutions to declare their loyalties. Lucretia faces increasing pressure from foreign representatives to support specific candidates while maintaining her diplomatic neutrality becomes impossible.

The chapter explores the personal and political costs of choosing sides during constitutional crisis. Noble families split internally as different members support different claimants, while military units face divided loyalties between competing royal commands. Foreign ambassadors openly court different succession candidates, offering military and economic support in exchange for future political concessions.

Lucretia and Cassius develop sophisticated intelligence operations to track shifting allegiances while attempting to identify potential compromise solutions. Their efforts reveal that traditional succession law cannot resolve the crisis because each claimant has legitimate claims under different legal interpretations.

The chapter concludes with Lucretia making the strategic decision to support stability over legality, recognizing that preventing civil war may require supporting the most viable candidate rather than the most legitimate one.

## Key Developments

- **Forced Allegiances**: Neutrality becomes impossible as crisis demands choosing sides
- **Institutional Splits**: Military units and noble families divide along succession lines
- **Foreign Interference**: International powers openly support different claimants
- **Legal Complexity**: Multiple legitimate claims under different succession interpretations
- **Strategic Realism**: Stability considerations override strict legal legitimacy

## Significance

This chapter marks the end of diplomatic neutrality and the beginning of active political intervention. Lucretia's evolution from neutral mediator to strategic participant represents the story's central character development, while the impossible legal situation justifies the unconventional methods that follow.

The establishment of clear factional lines creates the political battlefield that will define the remainder of Act I and set up the increasingly complex maneuvering of Act II.
