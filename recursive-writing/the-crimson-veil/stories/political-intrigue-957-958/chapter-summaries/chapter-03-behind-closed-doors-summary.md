# Chapter 3: Behind Closed Doors - Summary

**Timeline**: Early 957 AV, Month 1  
**Location**: Abandoned watchtower overlooking diplomatic quarter  
**Key Characters**: Cassius (intelligence operative), Commander Gareth Ironhold

## Chapter Summary

The story shifts perspective to reveal the intelligence networks operating beneath the diplomatic surface. Cassius, an experienced intelligence operative, conducts surveillance on Lucretia's embassy while assessing whether she represents an asset or threat to kingdom stability.

From his position in an abandoned watchtower, Cassius observes diplomatic activities while meeting secretly with Commander Gareth Ironhold, his longtime military ally. Their conversation reveals the true scope of the succession crisis: King Aldric has only six months to live according to court physicians, transforming succession planning from theoretical to immediate.

The chapter exposes multiple layers of political complexity previously hidden from diplomatic view. Princess Lyanna remains the designated heir, but Prince Marcus has been building support among eastern duchies while Prince Edward controls military assets through marriage alliances. Foreign kingdoms are already positioning to exploit succession instability, with the eastern empire seeking territorial expansion and southern confederation offering military support to different claimants.

Cassius and Gareth represent the kingdom's most stable institutional partnership—intelligence networks coordinated with military command—but they recognize their need for better information and stronger alliances to navigate the approaching crisis.
