Lucretia has evolved from traditional diplomat to master of political-intelligence operations, now serving as the kingdom's chief diplomatic officer with responsibility for preventing future foreign manipulation. Her transformation represents the evolution from reactive diplomacy to proactive political intelligence.

Cassius continues as intelligence chief while developing the institutional frameworks necessary to maintain the sophisticated intelligence capabilities that proved essential for crisis resolution. His networks now serve both domestic security and international political coordination functions.
