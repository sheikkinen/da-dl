# Artifact Profile: The Shadow Cloak of Umbrarum

## Name:
**The Shadow Cloak of Umbrarum** *(Pallium Umbrarum Tenebris)*

## Description:
A long, hooded cloak woven from midnight-black fabric that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it. The material feels like liquid shadow to the touch and shifts slightly even when there is no wind. The interior is lined with deep purple silk embroidered with silver thread in patterns that resemble constellations, but the stars move slowly across the fabric like a living map of the night sky. A brooch of black iron shaped like a raven secures the cloak at the throat.

## Origin/History:
Woven in 948 AV by the Shadow Weavers of the Northern Marshlands, master artisans who practice the ancient art of shadow-crafting. Edric Umbrarum commissioned this cloak after establishing himself as the Warlord of the Eastern Borderlands, requiring both practical stealth capabilities and a symbol of his command over the shadows. The creation took two years and required rituals performed during seven consecutive new moons, using materials gathered from battlefields and places where great deeds were done in darkness.
