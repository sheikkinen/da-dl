### The Seven Pillars of Honor

1. **Valor (Gaisce)** - Courage in the face of overwhelming odds
   *"Let no warrior flee from battle while his sword-arm remains strong and his heart beats with the fire of his ancestors."*

2. **Justice (Ceart)** - Fair treatment for all, regardless of station
   *"The strong must protect the weak, for strength without justice is tyranny."*

3. **Mercy (Trócaire)** - Compassion for the defeated and innocent
   *"Victory without mercy is hollow, for the true warrior conquers hearts as well as bodies."*

4. **Generosity (Flaithiúlacht)** - Sharing wealth and fortune with others
   *"What is won by the sword must be shared by the heart, for riches hoarded are riches cursed."*

5. **Faith (Creideamh)** - Loyalty to one's oath, lord, and the divine
   *"Let your word be your bond, stronger than steel and more enduring than stone."*

6. **Nobility (Uaisleacht)** - Excellence in conduct and character
   *"Noble birth is an accident of fate; noble character is a choice made daily."*

7. **Honor (Onóir)** - The culmination of all virtues
   *"Honor is not won in a single deed but built through a lifetime of right choices."*

## Key Passages
*"The warrior who lives by this code becomes more than man - he becomes legend. His deeds echo through the ages, inspiring others to greatness."*

*"Better to die with honor intact than to live with shame as your shadow."*

*"The sword may win the day, but only honor wins eternity."*

## Historical Impact
Brennos mac Cuinn's Code became the foundation for knightly conduct throughout the Celtic regions of Vaelthorne. It influenced the development of chivalric orders and established standards of behavior that persisted for centuries. Many knights would swear their oaths upon this very scroll.

## Current Status
**Sacred Relic** - The scroll remains in the Sacred Grove, tended by a small order of monk-druids who study and preserve its teachings. Only those deemed worthy by ancient trials may read from the original.
