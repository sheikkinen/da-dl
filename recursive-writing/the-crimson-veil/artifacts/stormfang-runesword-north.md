# Artifact Profile: Stormfang - The Runesword of the North

## Name:
**Stormfang** *(Stormtann - The Runesword of the North)*

## Description:
A magnificent single-edged sword with a slightly curved blade forged from meteoric steel that gleams with an inner blue light. The blade is inscribed with ancient Norse runes that glow softly when the weapon is drawn. The crossguard is shaped like raven wings, and the pommel contains a fragment of ice that never melts - said to be from the first glacier of the North. The leather-wrapped handle is bound with silver wire in intricate patterns that provide perfect grip even in battle.

## Origin/History:
Forged in 942 AV by the legendary weapon-smith Wayland the Smith-King specifically for Ragnar Bjornsson after his unification of the first three Norse clans. The meteoric steel fell from the sky during Ragnar's greatest victory, and the Norse shamans declared it a sign from the gods. The sword took three years to complete, requiring rituals and blessings from all the united clans. It was first blooded in the Battle of Iron Rapids (944 AV), where Ragnar's tactics revolutionized Norse warfare.
