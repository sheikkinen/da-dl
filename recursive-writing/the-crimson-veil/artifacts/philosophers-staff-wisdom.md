# Artifact Profile: The Philosopher's Staff of Wisdom

## Name:
**The Philosopher's Staff of Wisdom** *(Baculus Sapientiae Philosophorum)*

## Description:
A simple yet elegant staff carved from ancient yew wood, standing as tall as a man. The wood has a rich, deep grain that seems to shift and flow like water when viewed closely. The top is crowned with a crystal sphere containing what appears to be a miniature constellation that slowly rotates within. Five golden rings are set into the staff at precise intervals, each inscribed with one of the Classical Virtues in multiple languages. The bottom is capped with a bronze ferrule engraved with mathematical formulas and philosophical axioms.

## Origin/History:
Crafted in 953 AV by Master Osric Nebelhart during his meditative retreat in the Sacred Grove of Contemplation. The yew wood came from a thousand-year-old tree that had sheltered countless seekers of wisdom throughout the ages. Osric spent two years carefully carving the staff while contemplating the nature of existence, knowledge, and truth. The crystal sphere was a gift from his former student, Caelestis Stellarum, and contains starlight captured during a rare celestial alignment.
