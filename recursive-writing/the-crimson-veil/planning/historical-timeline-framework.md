## Next Steps for Timeline Development

1. **Create detailed chronology** with specific dates and events
2. **Develop major historical figures** who shaped each era
3. **Map political boundaries** changes over time
4. **Track religious and cultural evolution**
5. **Identify key artifacts and locations** and their historical significance
6. **Connect historical events** to current crisis and characters

## Questions for Collaborative Development

1. **Which historical periods most interest you** for detailed development?
2. **Should we focus on specific kingdoms/regions** for detailed history?
3. **How much should past events directly impact** current story?
4. **Which real-world parallels** should we emphasize or avoid?
5. **What role should elder races play** in this historical development?

This framework provides the foundation for a rich, multi-layered world with centuries of conflict, cultural development, and political intrigue leading to our current crisis.
