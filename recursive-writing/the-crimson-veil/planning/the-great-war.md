- **Assassination of King Aldric the Just** (958 AV) - succession crisis trigger

## Core Opposition

### **The Loyalist Coalition**:
- **Goals**: Restore legitimate succession, preserve traditional feudal order, contain Crimson Veil
- **Motivations**: Honor centuries-old oaths of vassalage, protect established political traditions
- **Resources**: Ancient artifacts (Aurelius Diadem, Code of Honor Scroll), established military orders, traditional noble support
- **Strengths**: Moral authority, unified command structure, access to historical knowledge
- **Weaknesses**: Rigid adherence to tradition, limited adaptability to supernatural threats
- **Key Figures**: Gareth Aurelius (righteous leadership), Brennos mac Cuinn (military honor), Aldric Magnus (religious authority)

### **The Usurper Alliance**:
- **Goals**: Modernize political structure, consolidate power efficiently, exploit Crimson Veil for advantage
- **Motivations**: End cycles of weakness that have plagued kingdoms for centuries, achieve stable empire
- **Resources**: Imperial artifacts (Crimson Crown of Unification, Eagle Standard), professional armies, strategic alliances
- **Strengths**: Pragmatic flexibility, military innovation, administrative efficiency
- **Weaknesses**: Lack of popular legitimacy, internal power struggles, overconfidence
- **Key Figures**: Theodoricus Ferrum (imperial unity), Cassius Ferox (military ambition), Edric Umbrarum (shadow warfare)

### **The Veil Cultists**:
- **Goals**: Embrace supernatural transformation, restore pre-Sundering magical era, transcend mortal politics
- **Motivations**: Belief that Crimson Veil represents evolutionary leap, rejection of failed political systems
- **Resources**: Ancient magical knowledge, supernatural abilities, artifacts touched by the Veil
- **Strengths**: Supernatural powers, fanatical dedication, immunity to conventional warfare
- **Weaknesses**: Fractured leadership, unpredictable powers, alienation from general population

## Stakes
- **For Loyalist Coalition**: Preservation of 960 years of feudal tradition, prevention of continental chaos, maintenance of righteous governance principles established during High Medieval Period (850-950 AV)
- **For Usurper Alliance**: Achievement of continental unity not seen since Vaelhart Empire (35-215 AV), modernization of political structures, establishment of efficient governance
- **For Veil Cultists**: Transformation of reality itself, return to Ancient Era magical power levels (0-200 AV), transcendence of mortal limitations
- **For Others**: 
  - **Drakheimr**: Preservation of isolation maintained since 289 AV vs. forced engagement
  - **Tír na Síthe**: Protection of secrets kept since Great Retreat (234 AV)
  - **Common People**: Survival after centuries of warfare dating to Warring States Period (300-500 AV)
- **Story Impact**: Determines whether Vaelthorne evolves into unified empire, returns to magical ancient era, or fragments into eternal conflict

## Escalation Points
- **Historical Buildup (950-957 AV)**: 
  - 952 AV: King Aldric the Just begins reign during period of stability
  - 954 AV: First manifestation of Crimson Veil disrupts magical and political order
  - 956 AV: Ancient prophecies rediscovered, connecting current events to historical cycles
  - 957 AV: Succession crisis emerges as supernatural events intensify
- **Initial Trigger (958 AV)**: Assassination of King Aldric the Just ignites three-way power struggle
- **Rising Tension (958-959 AV)**: 
  - Multiple claimants emerge, each backed by different historical traditions
  - Crimson Veil phenomenon spreads, affecting reality and magic across continent
  - Ancient artifacts activated as their bearers take sides in the conflict
  - Elder races forced to break centuries of isolation
- **Point of No Return (959-960 AV)**: 
  - Continental alliances form based on 960 years of historical grievances
  - Supernatural forces become uncontainable, affecting all political calculations
  - Traditional diplomatic solutions fail as Veil Cultists reject mortal politics entirely
  - War becomes inevitable as three incompatible visions of Vaelthorne's future clash

## Historical Resonance
This conflict represents the convergence of every major historical era:
- **Ancient Era (0-200 AV)**: Return of magical forces and elder race involvement
- **Warring States (300-500 AV)**: Political fragmentation and military innovation
- **Great Invasions (500-600 AV)**: Nomadic confederation tactics and cultural integration
- **Religious Wars (600-750 AV)**: Ideological conflicts and holy war declarations
- **Papal Influence (750-850 AV)**: Church-state power struggles and authority questions
