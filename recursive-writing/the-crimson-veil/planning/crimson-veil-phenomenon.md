# The Crimson Veil Phenomenon - Official Definition

## Nature of the Phenomenon

**The Crimson Veil** is a supernatural manifestation that first appeared in 954 AV as crimson mists rising from Llyn Gwaed (Lake Crimson) at the heart of Vaelthorne. What began as localized mystical events has gradually expanded into a continent-wide phenomenon affecting magic, reality, and the fate of nations.

## Physical Manifestations

### **Visual Appearance**
- **Crimson mists** that appear blood-red in sunlight but shimmer with otherworldly luminescence
- **Reality distortions** where the air itself seems to bend and waver
- **Spectral lights** that dance within the mist, sometimes forming recognizable shapes or symbols
- **Temporal anomalies** where time flows differently within affected areas

### **Geographic Effects**
- **Epicenter**: Llyn Gwaed remains the strongest manifestation point
- **Expanding influence**: The phenomenon slowly spreads outward in unpredictable patterns
- **Nexus points**: Certain locations (ancient stone circles, burial mounds, places of power) become secondary manifestation sites
- **Barrier effects**: The Veil can temporarily separate regions, making travel difficult or impossible

## Supernatural Properties

### **Magical Amplification**
- **Enhanced spellcasting**: Magic becomes more powerful but less predictable within the Veil
- **Spontaneous manifestations**: Non-mages occasionally display magical abilities near strong Veil areas
- **Artifact activation**: Ancient magical items respond more strongly to the Veil's presence
- **Planar thinning**: The boundary between the material world and other planes becomes permeable

### **Prophetic Visions**

### **Reality Alterations**

## Origins and Theories

### **Academic Theories**
