# Location Template: Llyn Gwaed

## Name:
**Llyn Gwaed** (Welsh: "Blood Lake")
- **Local Variations**: Y Llyn Coch (The Red Lake), Llyn y Niwl Gwaedlyd (Lake of the Bloody Mist)
- **Old Texts**: *Lacus Sanguineus* (Ancient Imperial records)
- **Common Tongue**: The Crimson Lake, Lake of the Veil

## Type/Category:
Large inland lake - Natural/Supernatural Feature (Epicenter of mystical phenomenon)

## Geographic Description:
A vast inland lake situated at the geographical heart of Vaelthorne, roughly circular with a diameter of approximately 15 miles. The lake sits in a natural basin surrounded by low hills and ancient stone circles. Its waters appear normal from a distance but shimmer with unnatural crimson reflections when viewed closely. The shoreline is dotted with weathered standing stones bearing inscriptions in multiple ancient languages - Ogham, runic script, and forgotten Imperial Latin.

## Current State/Condition:
**Active supernatural epicenter** - The lake is the source point of the Crimson Veil phenomenon that has begun affecting the realm. Red mists periodically rise from its surface, especially at dawn and dusk. The water itself remains clear and drinkable, but strange lights dance beneath its surface during nights of the new moon. Fish caught here are larger and more vibrant than elsewhere, though some display unusual characteristics.

## Population/Inhabitants:
- **Permanent**: Small fishing village of Gwaed-lan (approximately 200 souls) on the eastern shore
- **Seasonal**: Pilgrims, scholars, and mystics seeking to understand the phenomenon
- **Nomadic**: Traveling merchants who use the lake as a navigation landmark
- **Hidden**: Rumored cult of Veil-watchers who observe the lake's supernatural manifestations

## Key Features:
- **The Crimson Veil Nexus**: Visible distortion above the lake's center where reality appears thin
- **Cylch Cerrig Hynafol** (Ancient Stone Circle): Prehistoric monument on the northern shore
- **The Oracle's Isle**: Small island accessible only during low mist, containing ancient shrine
- **Harbwr Tawel** (Quiet Harbor): The village's modest port and fishing fleet
- **Bryn y Gwylwyr** (Watchers' Hill): Elevated observation point used by scholars and mystics

## Resources Available:
- **Fresh water**: Pure despite supernatural properties
- **Fish**: Abundant and unusually nutritious varieties
- **Stone**: Quality building material from surrounding hills
- **Mystical components**: Rare herbs that grow only in the lake's supernatural influence
- **Navigation**: Central location makes it a natural waypoint for all regions

## Dangers/Hazards:
- **Veil manifestations**: Unpredictable supernatural phenomena
- **Reality distortions**: Areas where normal laws of physics may not apply
- **Cult activity**: Potentially dangerous religious extremists
- **Political attention**: Multiple factions seeking to control the lake's power
- **Ancient guardians**: Rumored protective spirits that may not welcome intruders

## Historical Significance:
Sacred to pre-human civilizations - stone circles suggest ancient ritualistic importance. Imperial records mention the lake as a site of prophetic visions during the height of the Vaelhart Empire. The first appearance of the Crimson Veil phenomenon here (954 AV) marked the beginning of the current crisis. Ancient texts speak of it as "where the world's blood pools" and "the eye through which eternity gazes."

## Strategic Importance:
**Critical supernatural nexus** - controlling the lake may mean controlling the Veil phenomenon itself. Its central location makes it a natural meeting point between all major kingdoms. Control of the lake grants access to its supernatural energies and potentially the ability to understand or manipulate the Crimson Veil. Multiple factions recognize that the fate of the realm may be decided here.

## Notable Landmarks:
- **Maen Gwaed** (Blood Stone): Massive standing stone that glows faintly red at sunset
- **Pont Niwl** (Mist Bridge): Ancient stone bridge that appears only when the Veil is active
- **Ogof y Seithug** (Seers' Cave): Natural cave system used by oracle-priests for centuries
- **Tŷ Gwylio** (Watching House): Observatory built by Imperial scholars, now partially ruined

## Access Routes:
- **From Regnum Aethermoor**: Royal road leads directly to lake's southern approach
- **From Drakheimr**: Mountain passes descend to northwestern shore
- **From Tír na Síthe**: Hidden elven paths emerge at eastern shoreline
- **From other regions**: Network of pilgrimage roads converge from all directions
- **Water access**: Several rivers flow into and out of the lake, navigable by small craft

## Story Connections:
- **Theodoricus Ferrum**: The "Iron Emperor" likely seeks to control the lake's power
- **Caelestis Stellarum**: Strategic advisor studying the phenomenon's military applications
- **Aldwin ap Gruffydd**: Moral philosopher investigating the lake's connection to ancient prophecies
- **Veil Cultists**: Fanatic followers who worship the phenomenon itself
- **All major factions**: The lake's control is central to winning the war

## Atmosphere/Mood:
An ancient and deeply sacred place where the veil between worlds grows thin. The very air seems charged with potential, and sensitive individuals report feeling watched by unseen presences. At dawn and dusk, when the mists rise crimson from the water, the lake becomes otherworldly - a place where prophecies might manifest and destinies be forged. Beautiful yet ominous, peaceful yet pregnant with power that could reshape the world.
