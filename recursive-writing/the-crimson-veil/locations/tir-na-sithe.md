## Type/Category:
Elven Realm - Celtic Kingdoms parallel with seasonal court system

## Geographic Description:
Vast ancient forests with trees that grow impossibly tall and thick, their canopies forming living cities connected by graceful bridges of woven branches. Rivers of crystal-clear water wind between moss-covered stones, while hidden glades shimmer with otherworldly light. The very air seems charged with magic, and seasons can change within miles based on the courts' influence.

## Current State/Condition:
Increasingly withdrawn from human affairs but internally stable under the seasonal court system. The realm faces internal debate over whether their ancient neutrality can survive the growing supernatural crisis of the Crimson Veil phenomenon.

## Population/Inhabitants:
- **Primary**: Elven populations divided by seasonal court allegiances
- **Spring Court**: Focused on growth, renewal, and diplomatic contact
- **Summer Court**: Warriors and protectors of the realm's borders

- Wild magic that responds unpredictably to non-elven presence

## Historical Significance:
The elven realm predates human civilization by ages uncounted. Their courts have maintained the balance of natural forces since the world's youth. Ancient treaties with human kingdoms create obligations that may force their involvement in mortal conflicts despite their preference for isolation.

## Strategic Importance:
Controls the eastern approaches to the continent's heart. Their magical abilities could provide decisive advantages in supernatural conflicts. The realm's neutrality or alliance could determine how other kingdoms respond to magical threats.

## Notable Landmarks:

- **River routes**: Waterways that flow between human and elven territories
- **Ancient roads**: Forgotten paths from the time of closer human-elven contact
- **Seasonal doors**: Mystical passages that open during court transitions

## Story Connections:
- **Osric Nebelhart**: Natural philosopher may seek elven wisdom about the Crimson Veil
- **Aldwin ap Gruffydd**: Moral philosopher could negotiate elven involvement
- **Caelestis Stellarum**: Strategic advisor may coordinate with elven courts
- Source of mystical knowledge crucial to understanding supernatural threats

## Atmosphere/Mood:
A realm where time flows differently, where ancient songs echo through leaves that never truly die, where the boundary between dream and reality grows thin. The beauty is overwhelming and alien, touched with melancholy for ages past and wisdom too deep for mortal understanding. Every shadow might hide wonders or dangers beyond human comprehension.
