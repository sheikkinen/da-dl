His black hair is kept practical and short, often tousled from running hands through it while deep in thought.

## Backstory:
Born to a family of minor scholars, Caelric showed exceptional intellectual gifts from childhood. While other children played games, he studied military histories and devised theoretical battle plans. At age twenty, he entered the service of Lord Gareth Goldheart as a junior advisor and quickly demonstrated his strategic brilliance during the Border Skirmishes of the Eastern Marches. His innovative use of coordinated light cavalry, siege engines, and intelligence networks allowed much smaller forces to defeat larger armies repeatedly.

Unlike many military minds, Caelric combines tactical brilliance with deep moral conviction. He refuses to employ strategies that unnecessarily endanger civilians and actively seeks ways to achieve victory through deception and maneuvering rather than direct combat. This approach has made him invaluable to Lord Gareth's righteous cause while earning respect even from enemy commanders.
