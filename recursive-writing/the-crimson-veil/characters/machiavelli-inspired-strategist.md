# Character Template: Machiavelli-Inspired Political Strategist

**Niccolò Dominicus Ferrante** *(Niccolò "Victory of the People" - Of the Iron Will)*
- **Court Title**: "The Gray Eminence"
- **Official Position**: Chief Minister of Intelligence and Strategic Affairs  
- **Shadow Title**: "The King's Hidden Hand"

## Role/Archetype:
Master Political Strategist, Court Advisor, Spymaster

## Physical Description:
A lean man in his mid-forties with penetrating dark eyes that seem to catalogue every detail and calculate every advantage. Niccolò has prematurely gray hair that he keeps meticulously groomed, and his pale complexion suggests long hours spent in candlelit chambers reading reports and plotting strategies. He dresses modestly in dark, well-tailored clothing that allows him to blend into crowds or court gatherings as needed. His hands are ink-stained from constant writing, and he carries himself with the quiet confidence of someone who knows exactly how much power he wields. A thin scar along his jaw serves as a reminder of an assassination attempt that failed due to his own careful planning.
