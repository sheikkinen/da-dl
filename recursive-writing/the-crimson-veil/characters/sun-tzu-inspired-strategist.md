## Physical Description:
A man of middle years whose unremarkable appearance conceals one of the most brilliant military minds of his generation. General Sun Bingfa stands of average height with a lean, wiry frame that speaks of years spent on campaign rather than in comfort.

He dresses simply in dark robes suitable for travel, with no ornamentation save for a small jade pendant - a gift from his first teacher. His hands, marked by old sword scars, are most often seen holding brush and ink, mapping strategies or writing treatises. He moves with the quiet confidence of one who has faced death many times and learned to read the subtle signs that predict victory or defeat.
