A dignified man in his late fifties with steel-gray hair traditionally bound with a simple jade pin. His weathered hands speak of decades spent writing and teaching. Aldwin dresses in the flowing robes of a scholar - deep blue silk embroidered with silver threads forming the pattern of interlocking circles, representing the interconnection of all virtue.

- **Secondary**: Establish lasting academies that will continue teaching moral principles long after the war ends
- **Personal**: Train a generation of scholar-officials who can serve any righteous ruler with wisdom and integrity
- **Hidden**: Deep fear that the Crimson Veil represents a fundamental corruption that could destroy the moral order forever

- **Scholar-Officials Network**: Former students serving in administrative positions across multiple kingdoms

## Backstory:
Born into a minor scholarly family in the peaceful years before the War of the Crimson Veil, Aldwin showed early aptitude for classical learning and moral reasoning. At age sixteen, he witnessed the first manifestations of the Crimson Veil and the social chaos that followed, which convinced him that moral education was the only foundation strong enough to preserve civilization. He spent his twenties traveling between kingdoms, studying with masters and observing different approaches to governance. At thirty, he established the Academy of Five Virtues at Harmony Bridge, a strategic location that allowed him to serve as neutral mediator between warring factions.

For the past twenty-five years, his academy has trained hundreds of scholar-officials, many of whom now serve in key administrative positions throughout the realm. Unlike many philosophers who serve single kingdoms, Aldwin has maintained strict neutrality, believing that virtue transcends political boundaries. This neutrality has made him invaluable as a mediator, but also put him at risk as various factions try to either recruit or eliminate him.
