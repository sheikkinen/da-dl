## Role/Archetype:
Germanic Sage, Master of Natural Harmony, Forest Philosopher

## Physical Description:
An elderly man whose exact age is impossible to determine - he could be sixty or a hundred, his face bearing the timeless quality of weathered oak. Master Osric has long white hair that flows like morning mist, often adorned with simple ornaments from the forest - a raven feather, a smooth river stone, a sprig of sacred mistletoe. His pale blue eyes hold depths like mountain springs, reflecting more than they reveal. He wears simple robes of undyed wool that seem to shift color with the changing light of the forest, and he moves with the effortless grace of a deer through undergrowth. His most remarkable feature is his knowing smile - gentle, wise, and completely without judgment. He carries only a gnarled oak staff and a leather pouch of forest herbs, yet seems to lack nothing.
