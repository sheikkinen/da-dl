## Role/Archetype:
Taoist Sage, Master of Wu Wei, Natural Philosopher

## Physical Description:
An elderly man whose exact age is impossible to determine - he could be sixty or a hundred, his face bearing the timeless quality of weathered stone. Master Dao Wuxian has long white hair that flows like water, often adorned with simple ornaments from nature - a feather, a smooth pebble, a dried flower. His eyes hold depths like mountain pools, reflecting more than they reveal. He wears simple robes of undyed cloth that seem to shift color with the light, and he moves with the effortless grace of a leaf on the wind. His most remarkable feature is his smile - gentle, knowing, and completely without judgment. He carries only a worn bamboo staff and a small gourd, yet seems to lack nothing.
