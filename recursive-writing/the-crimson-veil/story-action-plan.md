# IMPORTANT - Working Principles

- **This document is our active collaboration hub** - update it as we make decisions
- Keep tasklist up to date - don't start a task unless it's documented and agreed upon
- Don't start writing actual narrative before plots, timeline and scene synopses are complete
- Always plan potential for helper tools before solving a task
- **Make collaborative decisions on major story elements** (like the nature of the Crimson Veil)
- **Bold items in tasklist indicate priority decisions needed**
- *Add document references to this document*
