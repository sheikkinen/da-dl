# Shared Tools

This directory contains scripts, automation helpers, and documentation for all tools used in the recursive writing project.

## Implemented Tools
- Story initialization script (`init-story.zsh`)
- Keyword search tool (`keyword_search.mjs`)
- Random inspiration picker (`random_inspiration_picker.mjs`)
- Theme/category explorer (`theme_category_explorer.mjs`)
- Timeline entry automation (`add_timeline_entry.mjs`)
- Copy template tool (`copy_template.mjs`): Copies character, scene, plot, or artifact templates, updates log, and adds timeline entry
- Automated test script (`test-run.zsh`): Runs and verifies all tools

## Planned/Upcoming Tools
- Scene creation script (template-driven, inspiration mining)
- Cross-referencing tool (linking characters, scenes, artifacts, etc.)
- Logging utilities (manual/agentic action logging)
- Story seed extractor (from metadata_index.jsonl)
- Image/description pair exporter

All tools are agentic, log-aware, and tested via the automated script. Document usage and add new tools as they are developed.
