## Visual/Atmospheric Notes:

## Artifacts/Objects Involved:
- Laura's wedding ring (she touches it constantly during emotional moments)
- Unsent text messages on Laura's phone to Diego
- Diego's work clothes (he's clearly come from the lighthouse)
- Carmen's concerned groceries (normalcy contrasted with emotional crisis)
- Laura's untouched coffee (loss of appetite due to emotional turmoil)

## Emotional Temperature:
Medium-high tension with underlying sadness. This scene slows the romantic momentum but deepens the emotional stakes by addressing Laura's core conflict directly.

## Character Development:
- Laura: Faces her guilt head-on, admits she's not ready for full commitment
- Diego: Shows maturity by setting boundaries while remaining supportive
- Carmen: Emerges as important secondary character who cares about both

## Foreshadowing Elements:
- Weather reports mention strengthening storm system
- Diego mentions needing to prepare lighthouse for rough weather
- Laura's emotional volatility parallels the approaching atmospheric disturbance
