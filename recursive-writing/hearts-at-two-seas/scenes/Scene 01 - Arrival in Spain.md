## Visual/Atmospheric Notes:
- Contrast: Finnish gray/cold vs Spanish golden light/warmth

- Sensory overload: sounds, smells, colors overwhelming after Northern European restraint
- Apartment as sanctuary vs prison

## Artifacts/Objects Involved:
- Laura's suitcase (containing red scarf from Mikael)
- Printed apartment booking confirmation
- Smartphone with unsent messages
- Balcony overlooking the two seas

## Outcome/Change:
Laura is physically in Spain but emotionally still trapped in grief. The intensity of the new environment both attracts and terrifies her. Sets up her need for gradual integration rather than immediate healing.
