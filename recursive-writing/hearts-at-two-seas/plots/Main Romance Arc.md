- Laura arrives in San Pedro del Pinatar, drawn by "two seas" symbolism
- Establishes routine: daily visits to cemetery rose garden, solitary beach walks
- First encounter with male lead - awkward, Laura retreats
- Cultural immersion: market visits, language barriers, sensory overwhelm

### Act 2A: Tentative Opening

- Laura begins Spanish lessons, cooking classes, social integration
- First genuine laughter since Mikael's death
- Physical attraction surprises Laura - guilt and confusion

### Act 2B: Crisis and Conflict
- Male lead gives Laura roses - triggers emotional breakdown
- Laura's backstory revealed: Mikael's death, three years of grief

### Act 3: Resolution and Integration

## Stakes:
- **Emotional**: Laura's ability to heal and love again

- **Spiritual**: Reconciling past love with present possibility
- **Physical**: Rediscovering sensual, passionate physical connection

## Resolution/End State:
Laura chooses love while honoring memory. She doesn't "replace" Mikael but expands her capacity for love. The two seas become metaphor for her heart's ability to hold both grief and joy simultaneously.

## Thematic Notes:

- **Cultural Bridge**: Love transcends nationality and language
- **Healing Waters**: Both literal (thermal springs) and metaphorical (tears, passion)
