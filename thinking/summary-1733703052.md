# Task Summary - Phase 4 Continuation

## Current Status
Continuing development of "Romeo and Juliet: Later Years" gothic romance story. Foundation Phases 1-3 are complete with solid world-building, character development, and one complete subplot. Currently in Phase 4 with 75% completion.

## Immediate Tasks
1. Complete Sacred-Profane-Conflict.md subplot (theological examination of undead love vs divine sanctity)
2. Develop Juliets-Final-Death.md into full subplot document 
3. Develop Eternal-Vigil.md into full subplot document
4. Finalize Phase 4 character relationship mapping

## Process Reflection
The systematic approach using templates and cross-references is working well. The mermaid diagrams and structured development phases ensure consistency. Need to maintain theological depth while advancing plot complexity.

## Next Phase Preparation
After completing Phase 4 subplots, will need to establish documentation standards for Phase 5 and begin scene sequence development.
