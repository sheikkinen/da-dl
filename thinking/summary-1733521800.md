# Task Summary - Fantasy Naming Strategy Update
*Generated: 2024-12-06*

## Current Task: Transition to Old European Language-Based Fantasy Names

**CONTEXT:**
Previously working on copyright verification for fantasy names in "The Crimson Veil" project. Found major conflicts with existing works (Stormwind, Shadowmere, Frostmourne all had copyright issues with major gaming franchises).

**NEW APPROACH:**
User has requested a strategic pivot away from English compound names to fantasy names based on old European languages. This approach will:
- Avoid copyright conflicts entirely by using historical linguistic roots
- Create more authentic fantasy atmosphere
- Provide consistent naming conventions across the world

**IMMEDIATE TASKS:**
1. Update existing fantasy naming conventions document to emphasize old European language usage
2. Develop specific linguistic guidelines for different regions/cultures in The Crimson Veil world
3. Create replacement names for existing locations using the new system
4. Update all planning documents with the new naming approach

**LINGUISTIC SOURCES TO UTILIZE:**
- Germanic/Norse (for northern/warrior cultures)
- Celtic/Gaelic (for mystical/nature-based cultures) 
- Latin/Romance (for imperial/scholarly cultures)
- Old Slavic (for eastern/forest cultures)
- Turkic/Mongolic (for nomadic/steppe cultures)
- Norman/Breton (for coastal/maritime cultures)

**STATUS:**
- Fantasy naming conventions document already exists but needs updating for this new approach
- Ready to implement comprehensive linguistic naming system
- Will replace problematic English compound names with authentic European language-based alternatives
