# Task Summary - "Romeo and Juliet Later Years" Story Initialization

## Conversation Summary
Building on the previous summary, we're now proceeding to initialize a new story called "Romeo and Juliet Later Years". This story expands on the classic Romeo and Juliet narrative with a supernatural twist - the famous lovers now rise every night as undead beings, their love transcending death itself. The story emphasizes secrecy due to the unholy nature of their undead existence.

## Key Elements to Incorporate
- Rich thematic content from existing "undead love" keyword searches in the workspace
- Classic Romeo and Juliet characters in their undead forms
- Nightly resurrection cycle
- Themes of love transcending death
- Secrecy and the social taboo of their unholy existence
- Similar setting to original but adapted for undead narrative

## Process Plan
1. ✅ Check story-initialization.md for proper initialization guidelines
2. ✅ Search for existing "undead love" thematic content in the workspace (15+ matches found)
3. ✅ Initialize the story structure using established tools - Complete foundation created
4. ✅ Create all required story files with proper cross-references - 11 major files completed
5. ✅ Establish the narrative framework for the undead romance - Ready for scene development
