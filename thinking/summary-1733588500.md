# Summary - Art of Love Phase Continuation

## Current Status Assessment
The Art of Love project has completed the initial framework development with:
- Complete strategic framework (13 chapters following Sun Tzu)
- Character archetypes and targeting strategies
- Practical field manual with examples
- World-building for modern dating landscape
- Timeline and assessment tools

## Next Phase Tasks
According to the 14-phase methodology, we need to:
1. Run keyword searches for additional inspiration
2. Use copy_template.mjs to create formal character, plot, and location files
3. Create planning subfolder with organized documents
4. Develop detailed subplots and plot documents
5. Create scene-level detailed timeline

## Self-Reflection
The project has solid strategic foundation but needs structural development following the proven 14-phase methodology to transform from framework into narrative-ready content.

## Process Improvement
- Use established tools (keyword_search.mjs, copy_template.mjs) for consistency
- Follow sequential development principle
- Maintain documentation standards with AI summaries and cross-references
