## The Stillness Before the Roar

Shehit burst through the underbrush like a whispered curse turned flesh—green skin gleaming under the fractured sunlight, eyes alight with a hunger not wholly feral. Her horns curved like declarations, her tail snapped like punctuation, and her grin… gods, that grin—it didn’t ask for permission.

I froze.

Not from fear. Not exactly. Something deeper. A pulse of fate, of recognition. The kind of stillness prey sometimes falls into when it knows the predator doesn’t just want to kill—it wants to understand you, to *claim* you.

She cocked her head mid-charge, leather straps fluttering against muscled thighs. Her run slowed to a prowl.

No weapons. No words. Just that impossible, curious smirk as she approached.

The forest held its breath.

*“Why don’t you run?”* she asked, voice low and sweet like sap boiled into poison.

I opened my mouth. I think to answer. I’m not sure.

Shehit didn’t wait.

With a grunt and a leap, she was on me—legs locked around my hips, arms around my neck. Heat rolled off her like steam rising from a fresh kill. Her kiss wasn’t gentle. It was a verdict. And I felt myself sentenced to something ancient and wild.

Branches groaned above us. Distant crows stilled in mid-call. Even the wind dared not interrupt.

The moment our bodies collided, the forest became a cathedral of sin. Every gasp echoed like prayer, every moan a warning. Moss dampened the earth but not our sound. Bark bore witness. Leaves curled inward, jealous.

*The forest will hear you scream.* And it did.

Prompt: continue, comment: At least I'm in no danger, for afterwards I find myself at her place.

Key points: after an eternity it ends. she's not done with you, carries to her cave, a pit only she can climb, the wait for more or an end 


## The Pit of Her Possession

At some point, it ends.

Or at least, the forest stops echoing.

My body lies spent on the moss-laced floor, yet her breath is still hot against my neck—hungry, unsatisfied, possessive. She licks the hollow of my throat as if sealing a pact written not in words, but in sensation.

*“You’re mine,”* she murmurs. Not a question. A decree.

The sky is dark by the time she hoists me up like a prize, slung over her shoulder with unnerving ease. Every movement of hers is primal, deliberate—like some ancient creature who knows no shame and even less mercy. The leaves slap past, the night thickens, and I realize I’m being taken.

*Not claimed. Taken.*

Eventually, we reach her den.

A cave carved into the cliffs, ringed with roots and the bone-charms of past lovers—or prey. She descends into it like smoke slipping through a crack in the world. I dangle, weak-limbed and half-dreaming, until she drops me gently onto something that might once have been a bed. Furs. Moss. Stones shaped by years of passion and ritual.

Above me, the shaft of moonlight narrows. The entrance—high, steep, impossible. Only she can climb it. Only she can leave.

She doesn’t.

Instead, she kneels beside me, straddling the silence. Her tail coils loosely around my thigh like a serpent marking territory. Her fingers dance across bruised skin with surprising tenderness. No words this time. Just her eyes, feral and unreadable.

Time loses meaning.

I don’t know how long I lie there. Minutes? Hours? Lifetimes?

Waiting.

For her return.  
For her mercy.  
For more.

Or maybe for the end.

Prompt: continue, comment: For she wants kids

Key points: Shehit once more wakes me and uses me. wildest ever night. impregnation done. final kiss - a first sweet one. leaves. week after i realize she is not coming back. arduous escape 

## The Seed of Her Legacy

She wakes me again.

This time, not with hunger—but with purpose.

Her hands are insistent, rougher, yet her touch trembles. She mounts me like a storm, her breath coming in broken gasps, her eyes alight with something deeper than lust. Something ancestral. Instinctual. Sacred.

She takes what she came for.

The forest outside groans with wind and wild life, as if bearing witness. Within the walls of her pit, I am no longer man, no longer prey. I am ritual. Function. Vessel.

And when it’s done—when the wildest night I've ever known burns itself into my blood like fire—she collapses onto me, shivering. Not with exhaustion. With fulfillment.

Then... her kiss.

A first.

Tender. Soft. *Sweet.*

*“It’s done,”* she whispers. *“He’ll be strong. Like you.”*

And she’s gone.

Just like that.

A week passes in quiet descent. I scream her name into the stone, claw at walls she climbed like ivy. She does not answer.

She will not return.

What she came for, she now carries. Somewhere in the forest, the next generation is already beginning to stir.

The climb is impossible. And yet, I begin.

Fingertips bleeding. Ribs aching. Every inch upward a prayer, every slip downward a curse. When I finally see the sky, it does not welcome me—it watches me.

And I walk.

Alone.

But forever marked.
