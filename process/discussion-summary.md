# Project Discussion Summary (as of 2025-06-05)

## Overview
This document summarizes the ongoing development and planning for the recursive writing project, focusing on agentic, testable tooling and modular story workflows. The project leverages a large metadata index, modular templates, and a suite of tools to automate and log story ideation, planning, and writing processes.

## Completed Milestones
- **Project Structure:**
  - Main and subdirectories for shared artifacts, tools, and templates established.
  - Story-specific folders moved to `story-template/`.
  - Shared templates (character, scene, plot, artifact, timeline) and tools directory created and linked.
- **Tooling:**
  - `init-story.zsh`: Initializes new stories, sets active story, logs, copies timeline template.
  - `keyword_search.mjs`: Searches `metadata_index.jsonl` by keyword, logs results.
  - `random_inspiration_picker.mjs`: Selects random entry from dataset, logs to active story.
  - `theme_category_explorer.mjs`: Lists unique categories, logs to active story.
  - `add_timeline_entry.mjs`: Adds entries to timeline markdown table.
  - `copy_template.mjs`: Copies templates, updates log, adds timeline entry (with optional datetime).
  - All tools use the `active-story` file and log to the correct story log.
  - `test-run.zsh`: Automates testing of all implemented tools, including timeline and template-copying.
- **Documentation & Planning:**
  - `action-plan-recursive-writing.md` and related docs updated to reflect tool progress and requirements.
  - `tools-brainstorm.md` expanded with implementation proposals.
  - `README.md` files in shared directories list templates and tools.
  - `status.md` in the process folder summarizes project status and next steps.
- **Testing:**
  - All tools verified via `test-run.zsh`.
  - ES module bugs fixed and retested.

## Pending/Next Steps
- **Tooling:**
  - Implement story seed extractor, image/description exporter, scene creation tool, cross-referencing tool, and general logging utility.
- **Story Development & Mining:**
  - Update story-action-plan with tool-centric process.
  - Brainstorm action-oriented scenes, review world-building, document approaches for action/grit.
  - Set up grep/alternative search for dataset, conduct inspiration mining.
  - Document-driven elaboration: character profiles, artifacts, locations, plot threads, scenes, chapter structure, narrative web, status doc, chronicles/metaverse levels.
- **Continuous Update & Quality:**
  - Establish update checklist, review sessions, document iterative principles, define measurable targets, set up progress tracking.

## Current Code State
- All implemented tools are agentic, log-aware, and tested via the automated script.
- See `action-plan-recursive-writing.md` for detailed checklist and progress.
