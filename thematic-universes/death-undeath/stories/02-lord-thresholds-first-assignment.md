# LORD THRESHOLD'S FIRST ASSIGNMENT

*An Eternal Threshold Character Story*

---

Five hundred years before Gabriel Mortis would stand beside the Bone Empress as her partner in governance, he was simply an inexperienced reaper struggling through his first week of death work. The angelic training academies had prepared him for the theoretical aspects of transition facilitation, but no amount of study could ready a being for the emotional reality of shepherding conscious souls through their final transformation.

His first assignment sheet trembled in his hands as he read it for the seventh time:

**Subject**: Thomas Brightwater, age 8
**Cause**: Fever, progression beyond healing capabilities
**Location**: Millbrook Village, Mortal Realm
**Special Considerations**: Child case—requires enhanced compassion protocols
**Supervising Reaper**: Master Serena Starweaver
**Notes**: Subject has been fighting illness for three weeks. Family is prepared for loss but may require additional comfort support.

Gabriel's silver wings folded tightly against his back as anxiety coursed through his celestial form. Child cases were always the most difficult assignments, and as a novice reaper, he had specifically requested to begin with elderly subjects whose time had naturally concluded. But Master Starweaver had been firm: if he was going to serve as a death worker, he needed to understand that transition came to beings of all ages, and his duty was to provide comfort and dignity regardless of the circumstances.

"Remember," Master Starweaver had told him during his final training session, "we do not cause death. We facilitate its natural progression with grace, wisdom, and compassion. Our role is to ensure that no being faces transition alone, afraid, or without understanding."

Now, standing at the edge of the mortal realm's borders, Gabriel wasn't sure he possessed enough grace or wisdom for what lay ahead. His silver robes fluttered in the cosmic winds as he spread his wings and descended toward the small village where young Thomas Brightwater lay dying.

Millbrook was the kind of community where everyone knew everyone else's business, where births were celebrated by the entire village and deaths mourned by all. As Gabriel materialized in the ethereal space between realms that allowed him to observe without being seen by mortal eyes, he could sense the collective grief that hung over the settlement like a heavy cloud.

The Brightwater cottage was modest but well-maintained, with garden beds that showed the careful attention of people who found meaning in nurturing growing things. Through the windows, Gabriel could see the family gathered around a small bed where Thomas lay pale and still, his breathing shallow and labored.

James Brightwater, a blacksmith with hands that could forge delicate jewelry or powerful tools with equal skill, sat beside his son's bed with tears streaming down his weathered face. "Please, Thomas," he whispered. "Please keep fighting. We need you here with us."

Mary Brightwater, a healer whose knowledge of herbs and medicine had saved many lives in the village, sat on the bed's other side, holding her son's hand while trying to maintain the composure that her profession required. But Gabriel could see the grief in her eyes—the terrible burden of a healer who could not heal her own child.

Thomas's older sister, ten-year-old Sarah, stood in the doorway, afraid to come closer but unable to leave. Her young mind was struggling to understand how someone so close to her own age could be dying when she felt so vibrantly alive.

Gabriel took a deep breath and stepped into his visible form, his angelic presence manifesting in the soft silver light that traditionally announced a reaper's arrival. The family looked up with a mixture of recognition and despair—they knew what his presence meant.

"James and Mary Brightwater," Gabriel said gently, his voice carrying the harmonic resonance that identified him as a celestial being. "I am Gabriel, and I've come to help your son with his transition."

"No," James said immediately, rising from his chair with desperate defiance. "He's not ready. He's going to recover. Mary's treatments are working—"

"James," Mary interrupted softly, her healer's training allowing her to recognize what her maternal heart wanted to deny. "The fever broke through the last of the cooling herbs this morning. His breathing..." She couldn't finish the sentence.

Gabriel approached the bed slowly, allowing the family to adjust to his presence. "May I?" he asked, gesturing toward Thomas.

Mary nodded reluctantly. Gabriel placed one silver hand gently on the boy's forehead and immediately understood the situation completely. Thomas's consciousness was already beginning to separate from his physical form, pulled toward transition by the failure of his mortal body. But instead of the peaceful letting-go that Gabriel had studied in theory, the child's spirit was clinging desperately to life, held back by confusion, fear, and love for his family.

"Thomas," Gabriel said softly, directing his words to the boy's consciousness rather than his failing ears. "Can you hear me?"

The child's eyes fluttered open, focusing on Gabriel with surprising clarity. "Are you an angel?" he whispered.

"I am. And I'm here to help you."

"I don't want to die," Thomas said, his voice barely audible but carrying the weight of absolute sincerity. "I want to stay with Mama and Papa and Sarah. I want to grow up and learn Papa's smithing and help Mama with her healing."

Gabriel felt his own eyes fill with tears—a response that he hadn't expected and wasn't sure was appropriate for a reaper. But Thomas's honesty demanded an equally honest response.

"I understand," Gabriel said. "And wanting to stay with the people you love is the most natural thing in the world. But Thomas, your body is very sick, and it's not going to get better. If you try to stay in it much longer, you'll be in terrible pain, and your family will have to watch you suffer."

"But what happens if I die? Will I never see them again?"

Gabriel hesitated. Reaper training had covered this question extensively, but the academic discussions seemed inadequate when faced with a dying child's desperate need for reassurance.

"Thomas," he said carefully, "death isn't really an ending. It's a change from one kind of existence to another. Your consciousness—everything that makes you *you*—will continue, just in a different form."

"But will I see Mama and Papa again?"

"Eventually, yes. Death comes to all living beings, but it comes at different times. Your family will continue their mortal lives for many years, but when their time comes, you'll be able to help them with their transition, just like I'm helping you with yours."

James stepped forward, his blacksmith's practical mind grappling with concepts he'd never needed to consider. "Sir Gabriel, are you saying that death is not permanent separation?"

Gabriel looked at the grieving father with compassion. "Master Brightwater, consciousness is more durable than physical form. When beings die, their awareness continues in different realms. Some choose to be reborn into new mortal lives, some transition to eternal forms of existence, and some serve as guides and helpers for others facing transition. But the love that connects family members—that survives all transformations."

Mary spoke up, her healer's curiosity overcoming her maternal grief. "What kinds of choices will Thomas have?"

"That depends on his own nature and calling. Some children who die young choose to return to mortal existence relatively quickly, reborn into families where they can experience the childhood they missed. Others discover that their compassionate nature makes them excellent guides for other children facing transition. And some find that death reveals abilities and interests they never could have developed in mortal form."

Thomas's voice was growing weaker, but his spirit seemed stronger as fear gave way to curiosity. "Would I still be me?"

"Absolutely. Your personality, your memories, your love for your family—all of that continues. You might gain new abilities, new knowledge, new opportunities, but you would still be Thomas Brightwater, son of James and Mary, brother to Sarah."

The boy was quiet for several moments, considering. Finally, he looked at his parents with eyes that seemed older than his eight years. "Mama, Papa, I'm scared to go, but I'm more scared to stay and have it hurt worse."

Mary leaned down and kissed her son's forehead. "Oh, my brave boy. If you need to go, then we'll help you go with love."

James took his son's hand, his blacksmith's strength barely keeping his voice steady. "You've been the best son a father could ask for, Thomas. And if Gabriel says we'll see you again, then I believe him."

Sarah finally approached the bed, her young face streaked with tears. "Will you watch over us? Like a guardian?"

Thomas smiled for the first time since Gabriel had arrived. "If I can, yes. I promise."

Gabriel felt a presence beside him and realized that Master Starweaver had arrived to observe his handling of the assignment. Her expression was encouraging as she witnessed the compassionate dialogue he had facilitated.

"Thomas," Gabriel said gently, "are you ready to begin your transition?"

"Will it hurt?"

"No. When I help someone move from mortal existence to spiritual existence, it feels like falling asleep and waking up somewhere beautiful. Your body will stop working, but you won't be in that body anymore, so you won't feel any pain."

"And you'll stay with me?"

"Until you're safely settled in your new existence, yes."

Thomas nodded, then looked around at his family one more time. "I love you all. And I'll see you again."

Gabriel placed both hands gently on the boy's forehead and began the process he had studied for years but never performed. Transition magic wasn't about forcing death to occur—it was about helping consciousness separate gently from failing physical form, ensuring that the process happened with dignity and without pain.

Silver light flowed from Gabriel's hands, surrounding Thomas with peaceful energy. The boy's breathing, which had been labored and irregular, smoothed into a gentle rhythm that gradually slowed and finally stopped altogether. But the silver light continued, lifting something invisible but undeniably real from the small body.

For just a moment, Thomas's spirit was visible to his family—a translucent, glowing version of their son, looking healthier and happier than he had in weeks. He waved goodbye with a smile that promised he would keep his word about watching over them.

Then the silver light carried him away, leaving behind a peaceful body that showed no signs of suffering or struggle.

The family wept, but it was the clean grief of loss rather than the agonized sorrow of watching prolonged suffering. They had seen their son transition with dignity, love, and hope for reunion.

Master Starweaver materialized fully as Gabriel completed the post-transition procedures, ensuring that Thomas's spirit had been safely delivered to the appropriate realm for further guidance.

"Well done," she said simply. "How do you feel?"

Gabriel considered the question as he helped the family with immediate comfort measures and connected them with mortal support systems. "Sad," he said finally. "But also... honored. Thomas trusted me to help him with the most important moment of his existence. And his family found peace in understanding that death is transformation rather than termination."

"And do you feel ready for your next assignment?"

Gabriel looked at the Brightwater family, who were beginning the process of celebrating Thomas's life while grieving his departure. "Yes," he said with newfound confidence. "I understand now that reaper work isn't about causing death or rushing people toward it. It's about providing comfort, dignity, and hope during a transition that would happen anyway."

"Precisely. And that understanding will serve you well as you develop your abilities."

As they prepared to depart, Gabriel felt something shift in his consciousness—a deeper connection to his calling, a sense of purpose that would guide him through centuries of death work and eventually to his role as Lord Threshold, partner to the Bone Empress in governing the complex relationships between mortal and eternal realms.

His first assignment had taught him that death was indeed transformation rather than ending, but more than that, it had shown him that his role was to serve love by helping it survive even the most difficult transitions.

Thomas Brightwater would be the first of thousands of beings that Gabriel would help transition with dignity and hope, but he would always remember the eight-year-old boy who taught him that courage, love, and trust could transform even death into a source of peace.

## Epilogue: The Letter

Six months later, Gabriel received an unusual communication—a letter delivered through the post-transition messaging system that allowed spiritual beings to communicate with their living relatives during the first year after transition.

*Dear Gabriel,*

*I wanted to thank you for helping me when I was scared and didn't understand what was happening. You were right—dying didn't hurt, and I'm still me, just different.*

*I'm learning to be a guide for other children who need help with transition. There's a school here where beings who died young can learn to help other young ones. I like it because I get to use my experience to make other kids less afraid.*

*Mama and Papa and Sarah are doing better. I visit them in their dreams sometimes, and they know I'm okay. Papa finished a garden gate he was making for me before I got sick, and now he and Mama sit by it in the evenings and tell me about their day. They can't hear me answer yet, but I listen.*

*Sarah is learning Mama's healing work, and she's really good at it. I think maybe she'll become a healer because she understands that helping people doesn't always mean keeping them alive—sometimes it means helping them transition peacefully.*

*I wanted you to know that your kindness helped my whole family, not just me. Thank you for staying with me and helping me understand that love continues even when everything else changes.*

*Your friend,*
*Thomas Brightwater*
*Junior Transition Guide, Academy of Final Comfort*

Gabriel kept that letter for the next five centuries, through his advancement to Master Reaper, his development of innovative transition techniques, and his eventual elevation to Lord Threshold. Whenever he faced particularly difficult cases or questioned whether his work truly mattered, he would read Thomas's words and remember that every transition facilitated with compassion created ripples of healing that extended far beyond the individual being served.

The Bone Empress once asked him what had inspired his particular dedication to ensuring that death work honored the dignity of all beings regardless of age, species, or circumstances. He showed her Thomas's letter and watched as her memory crystals glowed with understanding.

"Every leader," she said thoughtfully, "should have someone who taught them that their work matters. Thomas Brightwater was your teacher."

"Yes," Gabriel agreed. "He taught me that our role is not to bring death, but to ensure that when death comes naturally, it comes with dignity, understanding, and hope. Everything I've learned about transition work since then has been variations on the lesson he taught me."

That lesson had shaped not only Gabriel's individual development but his approach to governing the complex relationship between mortal and eternal realms. When beings understood that death was transformation rather than termination, they could face it with courage rather than terror. When families understood that love survived all transitions, they could support their loved ones' choices rather than clinging to them out of fear.

And when civilizations understood that mortality and eternity were different stages of the same continuous existence, they could build relationships based on mutual respect rather than fear and misunderstanding.

Thomas Brightwater, eight years old and facing the unknown with remarkable courage, had planted the seeds of wisdom that would eventually help bridge the gap between entire civilizations.

His first assignment had indeed been Gabriel's greatest teacher.
