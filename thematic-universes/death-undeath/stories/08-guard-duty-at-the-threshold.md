## Chapter 1: Night Watch

The Threshold between realms was never quiet, but tonight it was screaming.

Captain Morrigan Blackthorne of the Death Guard stood at her post on the Observation Deck, watching reality tear itself apart just beyond the protective barriers that separated the Eternal Courts from the chaotic spaces where lost souls wandered. Through her enhanced undead senses, she could perceive the disturbances that mortal eyes would never detect—ripples in the fabric of existence, tears in the boundary between life and death, and movement in the darkness that suggested something large and hostile was approaching the Courts.

"Movement in Sector Seven," reported Sergeant Kane, his voice crackling through the ossomantic communication network that linked all Death Guard positions. "Multiple contacts, heading toward the civilian transit routes."

Morrigan raised her spyglass—an artifact crafted from crystallized soul-essence that could perceive across dimensional boundaries—and focused on the disturbance. What she saw made her jaw clench with professional anger.

Reapers. But not the controlled, compassionate death workers of the Eternal Courts.

These were rogue reapers—beings who had abandoned their sacred duty to guide souls through transition and instead chose to harvest them for personal power. They moved through the Threshold like a pack of predators, their once-white robes now stained black with the essence of murdered souls, their scythes crackling with corrupt energy that turned gentle transition into violent consumption.

"How many?" she asked, though she was already counting the distortions in reality that marked their passage.

"Twelve confirmed," Kane replied. "Possibly more hidden behind psychic shields. They're moving in formation—this isn't random predation."

Morrigan felt a cold fury settle into her bones. Rogue reapers were among the most dangerous threats the Death Guard faced, because they understood exactly how the Courts' defenses worked and how to circumvent them. Worse, they actively sought to corrupt the transition process itself, turning death from transformation into victimization.

"Alert Lord Threshold," she commanded. "And activate the barrier protocols. Whatever they're planning, they're not getting through our perimeter."

But even as she gave the orders, Morrigan could see that the rogue reapers weren't trying to breach the Courts' main defenses. They were heading for something else—a section of the Threshold where newly dead souls first arrived, still confused and vulnerable, before being escorted to the processing centers.

They were hunting the newly transitioned.

"All units, emergency mobilization," Morrigan broadcast on the general Death Guard frequency. "We have confirmed rogue reapers approaching the Reception Zones. Priority Alpha—protect the civilians at all costs."

The response was immediate. Throughout the Threshold defenses, Death Guard knights began materializing at their battle stations, their bone-white armor gleaming with ossomantic energy. Veterans like Sir Ossian commanded the heavy assault units, while newer recruits took support positions under the guidance of experienced sergeants.

But Morrigan knew that even with their full defensive network activated, they were facing a problem that couldn't be solved through conventional tactics. Rogue reapers weren't mindless monsters—they were former colleagues who understood Death Guard procedures, knew the locations of defensive weak points, and had inside knowledge of how to exploit the Courts' own compassion against them.

"Captain," Lord Threshold's voice reached her through the communication network, "I'm en route to your position. What's our tactical situation?"

"Twelve confirmed rogues, moving in coordinated formation toward Reception Zone Delta," Morrigan reported. "They're not trying for a direct assault—this looks like a snatch-and-grab operation targeting newly arrived souls."

"Understood. I'm bringing additional assets to reinforce your position."

"Sir," Morrigan said carefully, "with respect, this isn't a situation where more firepower will help. Rogue reapers know our tactics because they used to be us. If we meet them with standard defensive procedures, they'll outmaneuver us."

"Then what do you recommend?"

Morrigan looked out at the approaching threats and made a decision that went against every protocol in the Death Guard manual.

"We hunt them," she said quietly. "We go into the Threshold ourselves and engage them on neutral ground, before they can reach the Reception Zones."

The silence on the communication channel told her that Lord Threshold understood exactly what she was proposing. Taking the fight into the Threshold meant abandoning the protective barriers and defensive advantages of the Courts. It meant engaging in open combat in a space where reality was unstable and where the very act of violence could tear holes in the dimensional fabric.

It meant accepting casualties to prevent a greater tragedy.

"Approved," Lord Threshold said finally. "But you take only volunteers, and you maintain constant communication. If the situation becomes untenable, you extract immediately."

"Understood," Morrigan replied, though she suspected they both knew that extraction might not be possible once combat began in the Threshold's chaotic environment.

She turned to address her immediate command unit—eight veteran Death Guard knights who had served under her leadership for decades. They were good soldiers, experienced in combat against entities that threatened the Courts, but this would be different from their usual defensive operations.

"I need volunteers for an offensive operation in the Threshold," she announced. "Hostile environment, enemy with insider knowledge, high probability of casualties. Anyone who wants to remain at defensive positions, speak now."

Not one of them moved.

"Right then," Morrigan said with grim satisfaction. "Let's go remind some rogues why they used to be afraid of the Death Guard."

## Chapter 2: Into the Chaos

The Threshold was not meant for sustained combat operations.

As Captain Morrigan and her unit passed through the protective barriers and entered the space between realms, they immediately felt the disorienting effects of dimensional instability. Gravity flowed in multiple directions simultaneously, time moved at inconsistent rates, and the very air shimmered with potential energy that could materialize into solid matter or dissolve existing objects without warning.

For living beings, extended exposure to the Threshold was invariably fatal. For undead, it was merely extremely uncomfortable and potentially damaging to their spiritual cohesion over time.

"Remember," Morrigan broadcast to her team, "the environment is as much our enemy as the rogues. Stay in visual contact, don't trust your magical senses beyond close range, and if you start experiencing identity fragmentation, report immediately."

The Death Guard moved through the chaotic landscape in a loose formation designed to provide mutual support while minimizing the risk of losing multiple team members to the same environmental hazard. Their bone-white armor had been enhanced with additional protective runes that helped maintain spiritual stability in the Threshold's reality-distorting effects.

"Contact," reported Sergeant Kane from the unit's right flank. "Single rogue, approximately three hundred meters ahead. Appears to be... feeding."

Through her enhanced perception, Morrigan could see the scene Kane had spotted. A rogue reaper knelt beside what appeared to be a recently arrived soul—a middle-aged woman who had probably died peacefully in her sleep, expecting to be guided gently through the transition process. Instead, she was being systematically drained of her essential life force while the rogue reaper's corrupted scythe absorbed her memories and experiences.

The woman was still conscious, still aware, but her essence was being consumed from within. In a matter of minutes, there would be nothing left of her but an empty shell—not dead, because she was already dead, but worse: a consciousness stripped of everything that made her who she was.

"Neutralize the target," Morrigan ordered. "Quietly, if possible. We don't want to alert the main group."

Sergeant Kane materialized behind the feeding rogue with the silent efficiency of a Death Guard veteran. His sword—forged from the willing sacrifice of a dragon's heartbone—pierced the rogue's spine before the corrupted reaper even realized he was under attack.

But instead of falling, the rogue reaper laughed.

"Too late," it hissed as Kane's blade emerged from its chest. "I've already taken what I came for."

The rogue's body began to dissolve, but not in the controlled manner of a proper undead's discorporation. Instead, it unraveled chaotically, its stolen essence exploding outward in a wave of corrupted energy that swept across the immediate area.

Kane was caught in the blast before he could retreat. Morrigan watched in horror as the corrupted energy washed over him, its touch causing his own spiritual matrix to begin fragmenting. The veteran sergeant stumbled, his form flickering between solid and ethereal as his consciousness struggled to maintain coherence.

"Kane!" She rushed toward him, but the damage was already done. The rogue's final attack had been a spiritual suicide bomb designed to corrupt anyone nearby.

"Captain," Kane gasped, his voice distorting as his identity began to slip away. "I can feel it... trying to change me. Like what happened to them."

Morrigan understood immediately. The rogues weren't just hunting newly arrived souls for food—they were trying to create more rogues through spiritual contamination. Kane had been infected with the same corruption that had turned the original reapers against their sacred duty.

"Can you maintain cohesion?" she asked, knowing that the answer would determine whether she had to kill one of her own soldiers to prevent him from becoming a threat to everything they protected.

"For now," Kane replied, though his form continued to flicker. "But not for long. Maybe an hour before the corruption reaches critical mass."

An hour. Enough time to complete the mission, but not enough to get Kane back to the Courts for proper medical intervention.

"Sir," Kane said quietly, "you know what you have to do if I turn."

Morrigan's hand moved instinctively to her sword. She had given the mercy killing to corrupted colleagues before, but never to someone she had served with for decades.

"We're not there yet," she said firmly. "Maintain formation and report any changes in your condition immediately."

The unit continued toward the main group of rogue reapers, now with the added pressure of knowing that they were facing an enemy that could turn Death Guard soldiers against their own mission through simple contact. Worse, they had learned that the rogues were actively trying to spread their corruption rather than simply feeding on souls.

"Captain," reported Private Torres from the left flank, "I've got movement ahead. Multiple targets, spread across approximately half a kilometer. They're... they're setting up some kind of ritual."

Morrigan raised her spyglass and focused on the area Torres had indicated. What she saw made her blood run cold.

The rogue reapers had arranged themselves in a complex geometric pattern around a massive tear in the dimensional fabric—a wound in reality that opened onto something dark and writhing. At the center of the pattern, they had placed dozens of captured souls, all of them newly arrived and completely helpless.

But this wasn't a simple feeding operation. The positioning, the ritual implements, the way the rogues were channeling their stolen power toward the dimensional tear—it was all designed to accomplish something far worse than mere predation.

"They're trying to open a permanent gateway," she realized with growing horror. "They want to give whatever's on the other side direct access to the Reception Zones."

Through the tear in reality, she could see movement—things that were definitely not human, not undead, not anything that belonged in the ordered cosmos of life and death. They pressed against the barrier like hungry animals sensing food, waiting for the ritual to weaken the dimensional boundaries enough to allow them passage.

"All units," Morrigan broadcast, "priority has changed. This is no longer a rescue operation—it's a prevention of interdimensional invasion. We stop that ritual at all costs."

## Chapter 3: The Price of Victory

The assault on the rogue reapers' ritual site became the bloodiest engagement in Death Guard history.

Captain Morrigan's unit struck from multiple angles simultaneously, using the Threshold's chaotic environment to mask their approach until they were close enough for direct engagement. The plan was simple: disrupt the ritual circle, secure the captured souls, and prevent whatever entities waited beyond the dimensional tear from gaining access to the Reception Zones.

The execution was anything but simple.

The rogue reapers had been expecting attack and had prepared accordingly. As soon as the Death Guard broke cover, the air filled with corrupted scythe energy and stolen soul essence weaponized into projectiles that could shred both physical and spiritual forms.

Private Torres was the first casualty. A blast of corrupted energy caught her in the chest, and Morrigan watched in horror as the young soldier's carefully maintained undead form began to unravel. Torres had enough time to scream once before her consciousness dispersed into component particles.

"Hold formation!" Morrigan shouted, though she knew the order was futile. The ritual site's chaotic energy was interfering with their coordination, making it impossible to maintain the disciplined tactics that gave the Death Guard its advantage over individual opponents.

Sergeant Kane, still fighting the corruption spreading through his own spiritual matrix, engaged two rogue reapers simultaneously. His movements were erratic—sometimes faster than humanly possible as the corruption accelerated his reflexes, sometimes sluggish as it interfered with his motor control—but his decades of experience carried him through the initial exchange.

His sword took the first rogue's head off cleanly, but the second managed to rake its claws across his back, adding fresh corruption to what was already consuming him from within.

"Kane, fall back!" Morrigan ordered, but the sergeant was beyond hearing rational commands. The accumulated corruption had reached the point where it was actively rewriting his personality, replacing his loyalty to the Death Guard with the same hunger that drove the rogues.

Morrigan found herself facing a terrible choice: allow a corrupted comrade to continue fighting alongside her unit, knowing he might turn on them at any moment, or eliminate him before he could become a threat to the mission.

The choice was made for her when Kane suddenly turned and launched himself at Private Chen, his sword aimed at the younger soldier's unprotected back.

Morrigan's blade took Kane through the heart before he could complete the strike.

"I'm sorry," she whispered as her old friend's eyes cleared for a moment, recognition returning just long enough for him to nod his understanding before his consciousness finally dispersed.

But there was no time to mourn. The ritual was approaching completion, and the dimensional tear was beginning to widen as entities from the other side pressed against the weakening barriers.

"All remaining units, converge on the ritual center!" Morrigan commanded. "We break that circle or we lose everything!"

The final assault was a desperate charge across open ground swept by corrupted energy. Three more Death Guard soldiers fell before they reached the ritual circle, their forms torn apart by the rogue reapers' defensive fire.

But the survivors pressed on, driven by the knowledge that failure meant not just their own destruction, but the opening of a pathway that would allow hostile entities direct access to the most vulnerable souls in the Eternal Courts.

Morrigan reached the ritual circle just as the lead rogue reaper—a being so corrupted that its original identity was completely unrecognizable—began the final phase of the summoning. Through the widening dimensional tear, she could see things pressing forward that defied description: entities of pure hunger and malice that existed only to consume and corrupt.

"You're too late, Death Guard," the lead rogue hissed. "The barrier is already failing. Soon, every soul that seeks sanctuary in your precious Courts will become food for the Devourers."

Morrigan's response was to drive her sword through the rogue's chest and channel every ounce of her ossomantic energy through the blade and into the ritual circle itself.

The feedback was catastrophic.

Her energy, designed to organize and protect spiritual matter, collided with the chaotic forces the rogues had been channeling to weaken dimensional boundaries. The resulting explosion tore a crater in the Threshold's unstable landscape and sent shockwaves through multiple dimensions simultaneously.

The dimensional tear began to collapse, cutting off the entities that had been trying to force their way through. But the violent interaction of opposing magical forces had consequences that none of them had anticipated.

Reality itself began to unravel around the ritual site.

"All units, emergency extraction!" Morrigan broadcast, though she wasn't sure if anyone was left alive to receive the message. "The dimensional fabric is destabilizing!"

The Threshold around them was dissolving into component chaos—not the controlled instability of the boundary regions, but true entropy that would reduce everything it touched to fundamental particles. They had perhaps minutes before the expanding zone of dissolution reached critical mass and began consuming the protective barriers around the Reception Zones.

But as Morrigan looked around for survivors to evacuate, she realized that she was the only member of her unit still conscious. The others had either been killed in the assault or were too badly damaged to move under their own power.

She could save herself, retreating to the protective barriers while the zone of dissolution consumed everything behind her.

Or she could try to contain the damage, knowing that the effort would likely destroy her.

Morrigan thought of the newly arrived souls waiting in the Reception Zones, confused and vulnerable, trusting that the Death Guard would protect them during their transition to undeath. She thought of the promise every Death Guard soldier made when they took their oath: to serve as shield and sword for those who could not protect themselves.

She thought of Sergeant Kane, and Private Torres, and all the others who had died believing that their sacrifice meant something.

"Lord Threshold," she broadcast on the emergency channel, "this is Captain Blackthorne. I'm implementing containment protocol seven. Tell my replacement that the perimeter held."

Before he could respond, she began the process that would transform her own spiritual matrix into a barrier against the expanding dissolution.

## Chapter 4: Aftermath

Lord Threshold arrived at the containment site seventeen minutes after Captain Morrigan's final transmission, leading a full company of Death Guard reinforcements and emergency response specialists. What they found was a sphere of crystallized reality approximately fifty meters in diameter, its surface reflecting scenes from multiple dimensions while its interior remained completely opaque to all forms of magical observation.

"Report," he commanded the senior sergeant who had been monitoring the situation from the defensive perimeter.

"Captain Blackthorne successfully disrupted the rogue reaper ritual," Sergeant Williams replied. "The dimensional tear has been sealed, and the hostile entities have been prevented from accessing our reality. However, the magical feedback caused severe dimensional instability in the immediate area."

"And the Captain?"

"Unknown, sir. She implemented containment protocol seven approximately twenty minutes ago. We've had no communication since."

Lord Threshold studied the crystallized sphere, using his enhanced senses to probe its structure. Containment protocol seven was a last-resort measure that involved sacrificing a Death Guard officer's spiritual matrix to create a stabilized pocket dimension around areas of dangerous magical contamination. It was effective at preventing catastrophic damage from spreading, but it was invariably fatal to the soldier who implemented it.

"Sir," Williams continued, "we've detected signs of life within the containment sphere. The Captain may have survived the initial implementation."

"But?"

"But protocol seven is designed as a temporary measure. The sphere will maintain stability for approximately seventy-two hours before the contained energies overwhelm the barrier and escape in an uncontrolled manner. If we're going to attempt rescue, we need to act quickly."

Lord Threshold considered the options. Breaking into a protocol seven containment sphere was theoretically possible, but it required exposing the rescue team to the same chaotic energies that had necessitated the containment in the first place. Worse, any failure during the extraction would not only doom the rescue team but also destabilize the containment itself, releasing the dangerous energies in exactly the way the protocol was designed to prevent.

"What are our chances?" he asked the emergency response coordinator.

"Honestly, sir? Less than thirty percent for a successful extraction, and that assumes Captain Blackthorne is still alive and coherent inside the sphere. If she's been compromised by the contained energies..."

"Then we might be rescuing something that's no longer recognizably her," Lord Threshold finished. "Understood."

It was the kind of calculation that commanders were forced to make: weigh the life of one officer against the potential cost of a rescue operation that could endanger dozens of others while serving no strategic purpose.

But Lord Threshold had served alongside Morrigan Blackthorne for over two centuries. He had watched her grow from an uncertain new recruit into one of the Death Guard's most capable officers. He had relied on her judgment in countless situations where the wrong decision would have cost lives.

She had earned the right to have risks taken for her.

"Assemble a volunteer rescue team," he ordered. "Experienced veterans only, full disclosure of the dangers involved. We bring our people home when we can."

The rescue operation took eighteen hours to plan and implement. The team consisted of Sir Ossian leading four volunteer Death Guard specialists, all equipped with the most advanced protective gear the Courts could provide. Their mission was simple in concept but extraordinarily dangerous in execution: breach the containment sphere, locate Captain Blackthorne, and extract her before the chaotic energies could consume them all.

The breach itself was accomplished through careful application of ossomantic energy designed to create a temporary opening without destabilizing the entire containment structure. It was delicate work that required perfect coordination between multiple specialists, any one of whom could accidentally trigger a catastrophic failure with a single miscalculation.

When the opening stabilized, Sir Ossian led the team into the sphere's interior.

What they found defied both expectation and description.

The interior of the containment sphere existed in a state of controlled chaos—reality flowed like liquid, gravity operated according to emotional rather than physical laws, and time moved in spirals rather than linear progression. At the center of this impossible space, Captain Morrigan Blackthorne sat cross-legged in meditation position, her consciousness extended throughout the sphere's interior as she manually maintained control over the chaotic energies.

She was alive, but she was no longer entirely human in any conventional sense.

"Captain," Sir Ossian called out, his voice somehow carrying clearly through the dimensional distortions. "We're here to extract you."

Morrigan's eyes opened, revealing depths that reflected the swirling chaos around them. When she spoke, her voice carried harmonics from multiple dimensions.

"I can't leave," she said simply. "The containment requires constant maintenance. If I withdraw my consciousness, the sphere will collapse within minutes."

"Then we'll find another way to stabilize it," Sir Ossian replied. "We don't leave people behind."

"There is no other way," Morrigan explained with the patience of someone who had been exploring every possible option for subjective hours. "The energies here are fundamentally chaotic. They can only be contained by a consciousness willing to sacrifice its own stability to impose order on entropy. Remove that consciousness, and chaos reasserts itself immediately."

Sir Ossian felt a cold realization settling into his bones. "You're saying you have to stay here permanently."

"I'm saying I chose to stay here permanently when I implemented the protocol," Morrigan corrected. "This was always the price of containment. I made the decision knowing what it would cost."

"But you're still alive. There has to be something—"

"I'm alive," Morrigan agreed, "but I'm not the same person who made the choice to stay. Constant exposure to chaotic energy changes you at fundamental levels. In another few days, I'll retain the memories and skills of Morrigan Blackthorne, but I won't be her in any meaningful sense."

The rescue team exchanged glances, each of them recognizing the truth of what she was saying. They had come to rescue their Captain, but the person they had found was already in the process of becoming something else—something that might retain Morrigan's knowledge and experience but would be fundamentally altered by the transformation.

"Is there anything we can do?" one of the specialists asked.

Morrigan smiled, and for a moment she looked like the officer they had served with for decades. "You already did it. You came when I couldn't leave, even though you knew the risks. That means more than you know."

She paused, her attention shifting to the chaotic energies that required her constant management. "But there is one thing. Tell Lord Threshold that the perimeter held. The Reception Zones are safe, the hostile entities were prevented from crossing over, and the rogue reapers will think twice before attempting another large-scale operation."

"We'll tell him," Sir Ossian promised.

"And tell him that protocol seven works exactly as designed. The next time someone has to make this choice, they can do so knowing that it accomplishes what it's supposed to accomplish."

The extraction took place without further conversation. There was nothing more to say, and prolonged exposure to the sphere's interior was beginning to affect even the rescue team's enhanced protective equipment. They left through the temporary breach, sealing it behind them, and returned to the defensive perimeter to make their report.

Captain Morrigan Blackthorne remained at her post, maintaining containment over energies that could devastate the Reception Zones if released. She would continue that duty for as long as her consciousness could impose order on chaos, gradually transforming into something that was no longer quite human but was still, in its way, a guardian of the Eternal Courts.

## Epilogue: Memorial

Three months after the Battle of the Threshold—as it came to be known in the Death Guard's official records—a memorial service was held in the Memory Cathedral for the eight soldiers who had given their lives to prevent the rogue reaper incursion.

Seven names were inscribed on the memorial wall, their service records read aloud, and their sacrifice honored with the formal gratitude of the Eternal Courts. But there was no eighth name on the wall, because Captain Morrigan Blackthorne was not technically dead.

Instead, her ongoing service was marked by a different kind of memorial: a monitoring station established near the containment site, staffed by volunteers who maintained communication with the sphere's interior and ensured that the energies remained stable.

The reports from those conversations made for difficult reading.

Captain Blackthorne remained lucid and capable of coherent communication, but her personality was gradually shifting as prolonged exposure to chaotic energy altered her fundamental nature. She still remembered her life as a Death Guard officer, but increasingly viewed those memories as belonging to someone else—a person she had once been but could never be again.

"She's becoming something new," reported the monitoring station's chief operator during one of the weekly briefings. "Not corrupted, like the rogue reapers, but transformed in ways we don't fully understand. She describes her current existence as 'swimming in possibility' and says she can perceive potential futures and alternative timelines."

"Is she still committed to maintaining the containment?" Lord Threshold asked.

"Absolutely. If anything, her dedication has increased as she's gained better understanding of what the chaotic energies could do if released. She views herself as a permanent guardian against a specific form of entropy."

"And her psychological state?"

"Stable, but increasingly alien. She's still recognizably Morrigan Blackthorne in terms of memories and core values, but her perspective on reality has shifted dramatically. She experiences time non-linearly and perceives multiple dimensions simultaneously."

Lord Threshold reviewed the reports with the same mixture of pride and sorrow that marked all his dealings with the memorial. Morrigan had accomplished exactly what she had set out to do—the Reception Zones remained safe, the rogue reaper threat had been neutralized, and the hostile entities had been permanently denied access to the Eternal Courts.

But the cost had been the transformation of one of his most capable officers into something that was no longer quite part of the civilization she had died to protect.

"Continue the monitoring," he ordered. "And ensure that Captain Blackthorne knows her service is remembered and valued."

"She asked me to give you a message," the operator said. "She says that the perimeter still holds, and that anyone else who faces the same choice should know that the transformation is worth the price."

Lord Threshold nodded, though the weight of command made it difficult to see the situation as clearly as Morrigan apparently did. From his perspective, losing a valuable officer to permanent transformation was a tragedy, even if it served the greater good.

But from her perspective—swimming in possibility, perceiving multiple dimensions, maintaining order against entropy—perhaps it was something else entirely.

Perhaps it was just another form of service.

In the months that followed, the containment site became an unofficial pilgrimage destination for Death Guard recruits completing their training. They would visit the monitoring station, listen to recordings of Captain Blackthorne's voice describing her duties and her gradually shifting perspective on reality, and learn about the price that might be required of them in service to the Eternal Courts.

Some recruits found the experience disturbing, confronted with evidence that their duties might require not just death but transformation into something beyond human understanding.

Others found it inspiring, recognizing that even the most extreme sacrifice could serve a meaningful purpose in protecting those who could not protect themselves.

All of them left with a better understanding of what it meant to serve as shield and sword for the vulnerable and the lost.

And in the containment sphere, Captain Morrigan Blackthorne continued her vigil, gradually becoming something that was no longer quite human but was still, in its way, a guardian of the dead and the dying, ensuring that their transition to undeath remained safe from those who would corrupt or consume it.

The perimeter held.
