# Chapter 3: The Question

## Chapter Summary
Celestine's first conscious question emerges: whether human suffering has inherent meaning beyond divine lessons. This theological rebellion begins with the cancer mother's scream echoing inside his perfect form, leading to dangerous speculation about suffering that serves no purpose.
