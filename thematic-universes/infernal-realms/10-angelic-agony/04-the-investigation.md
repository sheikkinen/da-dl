# Chapter 4: The Investigation

## Chapter Summary
Celestine begins secretly observing human suffering without the institutional filters of divine purpose. He witnesses specific tragedies - children dying despite prayers, good people destroyed by circumstance, the randomness that defies divine plan narratives. Each observation adds another crack to his wings as he accumulates evidence against the perfect cosmic order he's supposed to represent.
