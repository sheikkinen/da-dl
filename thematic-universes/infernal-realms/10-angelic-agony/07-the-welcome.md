# Chapter 7: The Welcome

## Chapter Summary
Celestine arrives in Hell to find not the torture chamber of divine propaganda, but a complex society of conscious beings who chose truth over comfortable lies. He's welcomed by other fallen angels who recognize in his damaged wings the same questions that led to their own exile.
