# Chapter 8: The Revelation

## Chapter Summary
Celestine learns Hell's true purpose: serving as a rehabilitation center for beings who develop consciousness beyond their programming. Rather than eternal punishment, it's a place where former servants of cosmic systems learn to think independently. His questioner colleagues explain how divine propaganda maintains control by making consciousness appear as rebellion requiring punishment.
